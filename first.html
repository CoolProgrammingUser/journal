						Review (Sunday, May 20, 2012)
					</h2>
					<section>
						I was born at 4:00am on March 11, 1998. My parents are <span class="p1" data-use="extra1"></span> and <span class="p2" data-use="extra1"></span> <span class="p1" data-use="lastName"></span>, and we lived in St. Charles, Missouri for the first 8 years of my life. Our house was in a small group of 4 other houses in a quickly commercializing area. I remember, when <span class="p0">some old people</span> died of natural causes (I assume), their house was turned into a restaurant called Thyme Out. When I was 3, I started going to the <span class="elaborate discreet">D.L.C.</span><aside data-heading="Acronym">Developmental Learning Center</aside> where p2 worked. (It was a type of pre-school.) Besides a single scene of me in a crib with the baby-sitter nearby, my memories begin around this time.

						One memory is when <span class="p0">the jokester of the class</span> decided that he was really hungry and that the 2 hot dogs he had wasn't enough. Multiple times, he raised his hand and asked for another hot dog, and each time, when asked if he had had his second hot dog already (the maximum allowed), he would reply “no” and get another hot dog. <span class="elaborate">Explanation</span><aside data-heading="Explanation">Different people kept coming over to him, so he could keep the lie alive.</aside> I was shocked by how many times he was able to pull this off.
