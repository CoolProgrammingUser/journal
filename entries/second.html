						Since you won't be able to see handwriting when this is typed up (although, actually, that might be an interesting effect to add), I'll tell you that this is me, Robert. p63 was going to write what she thought about this journal in here, but she had trouble deciding what to say &amp; eventually gave it back. p63 likes to write &amp; is very picky about the quality of her writing. She's also stubborn about not letting people read anything of hers until it's "ready". To date, I've only dragged out the beginning of a Phantom of the Opera rewrite, the beginning of a story being written for class, &amp; the prologue of a story she was writing in her free-time. All of those stories were <em>really</em> good, &amp; I wouldn't be surprised at all if she became a really successful writer. I'm not saying that because my mind is clouded with love; those stories really are good. She keeps saying how she thinks there's something not quite right about the story she's working on, but she's better than she thinks. p63 said she might add something in here later after she perfects the entry elsewhere, so 20 years from now, you might get her point-of-view. Looking in this notebook, I think she <em>did</em> try to write in here but tore the pages out; I'm pretty sure there were more than 3 pages left after the end of the previous entry, &amp; a mysterious shred of paper is stuck in the spiral binding which bears a striking resemblance to what's left behind every once in a while when you tear out a page.

						Anyway, I'm sure you must be wondering how Valentine's Day went (which didn't get snowed out). Since p63 decided she wouldn't give me her main present until I did, nothing particularly worth mentioning happened until Academic Advisory. Over the course of our many conversations, p63 figured out my "lesser pre-gift" although I never admitted anything, &amp; she never particularly said what she thought it was. Not wanting to be shown up in any way, she ended up getting me a candygram. I can't say I wasn't embarrassed when my name was called to come up &amp; get my candygram, &amp; I heard in the background, "Awww!" but I did like the thought. The message said, "I thought I'd get you something as sweet as you are to me. (Note: This is not your full present.)" That candygram not being her full present is a massive understatement, but I'm not there yet. After Academic Advisory, p63 told me how sweet my candygram was &amp; how she had figured out the first part of my gift. I told her what happened with her candy gram, &amp; like she always does, she apologized &amp; said she didn't know they'd called me up to get it.

						Skipping to the end of the day, we both ended up carrying a present to p63's bus. When we got there, I exchanged my notebooks for a giant, rectangular, red bag with a big heart on it &amp; other small, various decorations. As p63 was turning to go into her bus, I added, "And also..." She turned to face me, &amp; there was a pause as I tried to work up my courage. During that pause, I saw the doors of her bus close like they do when they're about to leave, &amp; I instinctively pointed it out. She started to run back to the bus, &amp; the doors opened. Not wanting to go through all of that for nothing &amp; waste a perfect opportunity, I said, "But..." She turned back &amp; gave me a look like "Well...?" &amp; I tried to use that time to follow through. However, the doors of the bus closed again, &amp; it was beginning to look pretty empty. Conflicted, I looked back &amp; forth &amp; back &amp; forth &amp; eventually decided that I couldn't let her miss the bus (or me, for that matter). I whined, "Ehhh!" &amp; ran off to my bus as p63 did the same.
					</section>
					<section>
						....I know, I know...... I really do think I would have kissed her if I wasn't rushed. I was beating myself up the whole bus ride back; I wish I wouldn't have dragged my feet so much. Valentine's Day was such a perfect opportunity; I can't believe I wimped out. I wanted some sort of special time to kiss p63 for the first time (&amp; for me to have my first kiss), &amp; I missed it. It wouldn't mean as much if I just picked some random time. I've been wondering about trying before she gets on her bus on my birthday which is the closest day that means much of anything (I don't think p63 is getting this back before then, so I'm not waiting to put in the specific day). I can't really come up with a plausible correlation between my birthday &amp; p63, but it's better than just any day, &amp; there's no way I'm waiting until her birthday (August 2) or next Valentine's Day. I thought about the last day of school, but that's kind-of far, so I'm putting a lot of effort into convincing myself to follow through on my birthday.

					<section>
						At some point between p63 reading through this &amp; now, I brought up the awkward conversation of how she'd react to me kissing her. She started off by saying she'd probably kiss me back, &amp; that she'd certainly blush. I asked if she would pull back in surprise which would make it extremely awkward to follow the rest of the way through, &amp; she said not unless I was too forceful. Since I wanted to be absolutely sure I wouldn't do anything wrong, I asked her to elaborate (which I'm sure made her pretty nervous). She said pinning her against the side of the bus would be going pretty far. My response was that she wouldn't have to worry about that. Somewhere along the line, p63 talked about how one of her friends, p77 (a twin who is the only French horn player other than p78 &amp; me), didn't kiss her boyfriend until they had been dating for 5 or 6 months. After saying that, she added in how she wouldn't want to wait <em>that</em> long, but she doesn't want to rush me.

					<section>  <!-- Check transcription -->
						Although it's nice how p63 tries to not make me feel pressured by not telling me general times when she'd like things to happen or times when she hears other people say when they think things should happen, it causes me to be completely clueless as to how I should pace myself. It's lucky that p63 &amp; I are so similar which prevents things like that from becoming too problematic, but I do wish she would give me an idea of how she'd like our relationship to progress. I know she would be polite about it, &amp; I would actually appreciate a nudge in the right direction. I've actually told her things along those lines before, but she's too scared of pushing me. For one thing, she would have to do a whole lot more than attempt to keep me on par with normal people, which is what I try to do anyway, to cause me to even remotely consider parting ways with her. For another thing, she has told me before that I can talk to her about anything. Well, she can tell me anything too. I like people talking to me, especially like when talking to me helps someone feel better, &amp; if that's not enough, I have an extreme tolerance for pretty much everything, so it's next to impossible to unintentionally offend me. In addition, p63 has an advantage. I love her. I truly do love her with all of my heart &amp; as deeply as you can imagine. If anyone should be immune to fear of driving me away, it's the love of my life. She doesn't have to be afraid of pushing me.

						So anyway, I didn't end up kissing p63. It makes me wonder if you saw that coming beforehand.
					</section>
					<section>
						I didn't feel bad for too long, though. After all, there was p63's present to think about. When I got off the bus, I saw <span class="person p68">the bus driver</span> smiling at my huge bag, which made me feel awkward. As I approached my house, I wasn't looking forward to the embarrassment that my parents would cause because of the extremely obvious sign of affection. That day was one of the rare days p2 was home on a weekday, so she was the first one to greet me when I walked in. By some miracle, she was caught up in a song &amp; she ignored my bag, which was far too large to successfully hide using only my body to conceal it. By some other miracle, p1, who would certainly say something about it, was in the bathroom, so I had a chance to place it out of sight. Eventually, I snuck it up to my room &amp; got a chance to take out his contents.

					<section>
						I would have never guessed there was so much in that bag. Hidden amongst the red tissue paper with hearts was a note explaining the gifts, a package of chocolate fudge hearts with a small balloon saying, be mine, a box of four huge chocolates in the shape of Xs &amp; Os for how sweet I am, a package of multiple boxes of sweethearts – does that really need to be explained? – a bunch of sparkly smiley face stickers for how happy I make her, a card written in likely bad French – she's taking French, I'll have to wait until next year when I take French to read it, a really good small yellow paper rose, an empty paper box with a note saying, it's filled with courage to help me progress in our relationship &amp; pursue other things I want to do, a package of bubble-making fluid for how light I make her feel, &amp; finally an extremely sweet poem.
					</section>
					<section>
						I couldn't believe she did all of that for me, &amp; she says I'm sweet. She has been trying to come up with some way to repay her compliment debt, even though I tell her not to worry about it. I'd say she was quite successful. I was, &amp; still am, blown away by how much effort she put into my Valentine's Day present. I think the best part was the poem. It would be too long to write in here, but I might put it at the end of this entry, like how I might put in my Americanism essay when it comes time to publish this. It was really nice, though. I've read it multiple times, &amp; I love it every time. Each time I'm finished, all I can think is, "I love her", which just like what I think every time I see her picture as the wallpaper of my phone.
					</section>
					<section>
						I love her so much. I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever if we ended up getting married. I certainly love her enough, &amp; we get along better than tons of people who've been married for years. P1 says that I shouldn't get married until I'm out of college, which is reasonable, so that would be the general time I'd propose if I decided to do so, which is quite likely. You may think I'm jumping the gun, but she is such an amazing person in my eyes. I've really fallen for her, which isn't easy to do. For the record, I wouldn't marry her right now if I had the opportunity, &amp; would probably wait at least a year or two more so I wouldn't get ahead of myself, even with age being ignored. But that doesn't mean I'm not sure if I could take being married to her at the moment. p63 is the love of my life, &amp; other than me chickening out, I think Valentine's Day went perfectly.
