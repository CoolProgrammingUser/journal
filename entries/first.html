				This will recount every important event in my life from birth to the first time I shared this journal with someone (in 10<sup>th</sup> grade). Keep in mind that, although I've added some things and tried to reformat others, this was originally written completely in notebooks with no expectation of it being put into a website (at least not any time soon). I also didn't bother with putting paragraph breaks anywhere for a long time, so I just made up wherever I thought was a good spot (which is pretty much what I do now anyway). In case you don't glance over the <a href="../indicators.html" target="_self">Indicators</a> page first (which you should) or you don't know how to interpret what I said, the things I've added at a time later than the date shown at the beginning of the entry are indicated with an <span class="afterthought">afterthought</span> styling, and <span class="elaborate">dotted underlines</span> and people's names are clickable.
				<aside data-heading="Seriously?">Did you really just click on that?</aside>
				Upon copying the content into this website, I tried to reword the introduction of my journal in the first entry since that was the one place I gave myself permission to make sure everything was relevant to my audience when it came time to publish (which I originally imagined to be in a book); however, as I got farther along in my copying efforts, I noticed the occasional reference back to the way the introduction was originally written, and I wasn't about to update every small reference to the way things were (assuming I'd be able to catch them all), and that level of revision bordered on rewriting my history anyway (since, for example, I may have decided to write about something I mentioned in the introduction because I forgot to do so elsewhere), so I brought back the original introduction. You'll probably find it interesting to read how I introduced my journal when I was 14, anyway. In case you're wondering (or will wonder), it's because of this type of problem that I also didn't cut and paste the events from my childhood into the correct order (since outlining first is for losers, and I didn't remember everything in order). I corrected the occasional spelling error (which I wouldn't have made in the first place if I had spellcheck or if English wasn't dumb), and I might've made a small revision if I thought something was unclear or hard-to-follow, but it's quite rare that I did anything at all (besides <span class="afterthought">add stuff</span>) because I didn't make many mistakes in the first place (in my opinion), and I wanted to keep as much of my original writing style in-tact as possible.

					<section>
						Hello, my name is Robert Tour Benson. I am writing this journal so that <span style="text-decoration:underline">when</span> I become famous for reasons you will soon see, people will know what happened to me leading up to it. Also, it will save me from needing to take forever writing an autobiography, &amp; I think the more casual &amp; conversational sort of tone will be more interesting than just boring facts. It's all true, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/me/Soon after my birth.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						First let me start by going over what has already happened. On March 11, 1998, I was born. I have red hair and freckles. I think my eyes look more bluish-green, but officially, they're blue. Also, just in case you see me in shorts &amp; notice something above the front of my right ankle &amp; wonder, "What happened?" Nothing happened. It's a red birthmark.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/My parents' wedding picture from 1995-7-1.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:14em">
						My parents are p1.firstName p1.middleName p1.lastName and p2.firstName p2.middleName p2.lastName. I don't really have any siblings, but I'll get to that later. For 8 years of my life I grew up at <span class="elaborate">5314 Highway N, St. Charles, Missouri</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							I was so specific with the address because I wanted it to be possible to track down the childhood home of the famous Robert Benson. I originally had the ZIP code written as well, but I erased it later because I thought it was excessive. (It doesn't even matter, anyway, because the city is more specific than the ZIP code in that part of the state.) This address rolled off my tongue very easily for many, many years because I had to recite it so frequently as a child, almost certainly so I could tell someone where I lived if I ever got lost.
						</aside>
						It was with a group of 4 other houses in a quickly commercializing area. I remember, when <span class="p0">some old people</span> died naturally, their house was turned into a restaurant called <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thyme-out-cafe-cottleville-2">Thyme Out</a>. When I was 3 I was sent to the <span class="elaborate">D.L.C.</span><aside data-heading="Acronym">Developmental Learning Center</aside> to learn where p2 worked. (It was a type of pre-school.) Besides a single scene of me in a crib with the baby-sitter nearby, my memories begin around this time.
					</section>
					<section class="t11" data-coolness="1">
						One memory is when <span class="p0">the jokester of the class</span> decided that he was really hungry and that the 2 hot dogs he had wasn't enough. Multiple times, he raised his hand and asked for another hot dog, and each time, when asked if he had had his second hot dog already (the maximum allowed), he would reply "no" and get another hot dog. <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious" data-date="2018/6/18">Explanation</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2018/6/18">
							Different people kept coming over to him, so he could keep the lie alive.
						</aside>
						I was shocked by how many times he was able to pull this off.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other major memory was when I first rode the bus, had a substitute bus driver, or both. There was <span class="p0">this girl</span> that was a few years older than me who also rode the bus and got off at the D.L.C. building with me. When we arrived, I got up and started to leave, but I noticed that she wasn't coming. She was talking to her friends, so I tried to get her attention, but it wasn't enough to get her attention mostly because I was too shy like I am now except now I'm a little less. I told the bus driver about it, but he didn't do much about it and eventually I got off the bus. A little while later the bus came back and dropped off the girl (I can't remember her name). She was upset, and she asked me why I didn't tell her to get off.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						Although there are bits and pieces of other memories from this time, one more I think might be of interest is one time when I was eating lunch with the class in <span class="elaborate">pre-K</span>. During this particular lunch, p2 happened to walk by, and when she did so, I enthusiastically greeted her with a "Hi <span class="person p2">Mommy</span>!" Immediately after doing so, the entire class including the teacher stared at me in silence for what felt like an eternity before going back to their business. It could've been that they were just staring at me for making a scene, but I was worried that they were thinking I was too old to be using a word like "Mommy", and I didn't want to take the chance, so from that point forward, I never referred to my parents as <span class="person p2">Mommy</span> or <span class="person p1">Daddy</span> again.
						<aside data-heading="Abbreviation">
							In case you couldn't figure it out, "pre-K" is short for "pre-Kindergarten" (although no one ever refered to it as that). It was the last of four stages that you went through as you grew up at the D.L.C..
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						While I'm listing other largely insignificant memories, I'll tell you that there was another when I was younger, and I needed to use the bathroom, but before I could make it all the way to the door, a teacher grabbed me and changed my (dry) diaper. Since it didn't seem like I would be allowed to use the bathroom while I was there, from that point forward, I would only go to the bathroom before or after being at the D.L.C..
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, in 2005 (when I was going into 2<sup>nd</sup> grade) p2 started working at <a href="https://warren.fhsdschools.org/">Warren Elementary</a> (my elementary school), so I stopped being dropped off at the D.L.C. from the bus and started being driven to school. Just in case you're wondering, p1 worked at National Vendors <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(a vending machine manufacturer)</span> but it didn't affect my life much so there's no point in writing about it. Throughout elementary school there was a pretty good amount of things of importance that happened.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing that happened is I learned to hate M.A.P. testing (Missouri Assessment Program), and wish I lived in Nebraska (<span class="elaborate">Nebraska Assessment Program</span>).
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							In case you don't get it, the joke is that, in Nebraska, I would be tested on napping.

					</section>
					<section id="iceCreamOreoCakeStory" data-coolness="2">
						Another thing that <span class="h3">I think is important</span> is that I learned my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher p3's Ice Cream Oreo Cake recipe! <span class="afterthought elaborate" data-date="2023/1/9">(It was a whole ordeal.)</span>
						<aside class="afterthought t1" data-heading="Ordeal" data-date="2023/1/9">
							As an end of the year reward, p3 was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, p3 made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked p3 for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, p3 tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since p2 was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with p3 about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, p3 kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to p3 one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.
						</aside>
						Since it's so amazing, I'll put the recipe in <span class="elaborate">here</span> so it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
						<aside class="t2" data-heading="Recipe">
							<ol>
								<li>Crush up Oreos, and put them at the bottom of the container you want.</li>
								<li>Melt some butter and pour it on the Oreo crumbs to make sure the bottom is stiff.</li>
								<li>Melt some ice cream a little and put it on.</li>
								<li>Freeze it all.</li>
								<li>Put on a layer of fudge (we're wimpy and use chocolate syrup) and a layer of whipped cream.</li>
								<li>Crush up some more Oreos and sprinkle them on top.</li>

								Now I may have forgotten one or two small steps, but if you do only what I said, you'll be fine.

						Back to what I was saying earlier, something else that is <span class="h1">super important</span> from elementary school was when, in 5<sup>th</sup> grade, we learned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJJmQojcLM">pi song</a> (yes pi).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something that actually was important is a collection of things that happened. I know this may sound cocky, but, throughout most of elementary school, I believe I was maturing more to a middle school level (see where if sounds cocky) but not with only good qualities. I was beginning to act like early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> graders would act in school which isn't the most pleasant. Luckily for me, this happened before everyone actually was in early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, so it wasn't accepted. I think that, if people would have accepted the things I did like they would have in 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I wouldn't be nearly as well-mannered (I'm not saying I'm completely well-mannered) as I would have been, and my life could have turned out a lot differently. Sometimes I wonder if I just got really lucky having this happen to me, &amp; other times, I think it would have been inevitable. The world may never know.
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Another impact on my life was my Spectra (class for gifted students) teacher, p4. I was always pretty shy and didn't want to make myself too noticeable, but p4 made sure that changed. She would always force us to act in skits and try to participate in discussions. VERY slowly, I came out of my shell. I'm not saying I'm the most out-going person now, but I'm a lot more than I was (which still isn't much). Something good, though, is that, now, I can choose to be out-going, but don't expect me to do so without a good, specific reason. I'm a pretty (amount not attribute) reserved &amp; mild person.

						<section>
							A final important event from my elementary school career was when I slept over at my friend p5's house for his birthday party. Before we went to bed there, we had cake and presents and did a few other things. When night came and everyone went to bed, not everyone could fall asleep immediately; I was one of those people. For a long time I couldn't fall asleep, and during that time, I heard a bunch of strange noises. It sounded like <span class="person p6 noindex">someone</span> got out of their sleeping bag, went down the steps, after a while caused a popping or hitting noise, then ran up the stairs and started breathing heavy. Soon afterwards, the person went back in their sleeping bag which was followed by what sounded like <span class="person p7 noindex">someone else</span> getting out of theirs for a short time and then getting back in. In the morning, everyone was awake and gathered around a small table having a discussion. I must not have missed much because nothing referred back to something I didn't hear. When I began listening, my friend, p6, started talking about that night.
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="person p6">He</span> said that he thought he heard a noise come from the basement so he went to check it out. Once he got there, he says he picked up the duct tape bat (yes, duct tape bat. It was pretty fat) and headed towards what he thought made the sound. Suddenly, the thing rushed out and he hit it with the bat. In the process, though, he says it scratched him. At this time he showed us what, if you looked REALLY hard and used your imagination a little, might look like a scratch. I couldn't tell what everyone else was thinking, but what I was thinking was that you could hardly even pass that off as a scratch, but you want us to believe that you got that from some strange, alien thing and that, just yesterday night (he told us this also), it was bleeding and somehow it magically healed to become this nearly non-existent, miniscule mark that you hold before us today. I didn't say anything about it because no one else was, and it didn't seem like he was lying about the rest of his story. He said that after that, he ran up the steps with it in pursuit (he might have said he knocked it back a few times or something) and then slammed and locked the door to where we were all sleeping. After that, he went back in his sleeping bag. Since we were all curious, he drew us a picture of the "alien". It looked small, had a big head, slits for a nose, and was gray.
						</section>
						<section>
							But that wasn't an end to the story-telling. When we were finished looking at the picture, p7 started saying what happened to him that same night. He said that he was awakened by the sound of p6 slamming the door and got up to see what was going on. He says that he looked out the window in the room and saw something really strange. Supposedly he saw a light post, (there wasn't one) a flying saucer above it, and a bunch of aliens on the ground. I can't remember his exact description of the aliens, I'm pretty sure they had red eyes or something was red, but I remember the distinct impression that p7's aliens and p6's alien descriptions didn't quite match. Despite the discrepancies, they didn't seem like they were lying, and I find it hard to believe, since their stories matched up with what I heard, that they would get up in the middle of the night and act it all out for anyone who might be listening with their eyes closed because they couldn't get to sleep. I'm not saying they couldn't have exaggerated a little something they saw into something ridiculous though. I'm sure you can see where this is going, but too bad! You're just going to have to suffer through it.
						</section>
						<section>
							After all of that, I think we stocked up on fake guns and then went on an all out alien hunt! As time went on, more and more people said they saw an alien. I think, somewhere along the line, p5 (whose sleepover it was) said that he thought aliens had come by before (not necessarily in his house). We also came up with color codes (like "code red" or "code blue") for what type of alien encounter we had so everyone could come and see for themselves. It never worked out which made sense to me because if you're yelling anything the alien is going to run away. So this went on for a long time and eventually everyone wanted to go inside to get a drink and "reload". I didn't really need to do all of that, so I stayed outside along with my friend, p8. As I was waiting, I wandered down the hill (p5's house was on a medium one), and p8 followed. When I looked around, I saw something that caught my eye: it was moving at a slow jog, was white, not much taller than me (now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I was 7, so I wasn't too tall), its head was blocked by the neighbor's deck, it was skinny, and had five fingers and three toes. It seemed that it was coming from the woods to the far side of the neighbor's house, so I rushed over there with surprising speed only to find that it was gone.
						</section>
						<section class="t4">
							I know what you're thinking, "This dude is crazy. Why should I listen to anything else he has to say?" but don't discredit everything else because of this one thing. I promise you this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. I'm not going to lie to you. As I was writing this memory I was thinking, "Gee, this sounds exactly like some fictional story that I'm making up," but I'm telling you it's not! You may say, "That was some guy in a costume," or "You must have remembered it wrong," or "You're just insane!" and you may be right (except for the last one), but I don't think so. One thing I hope you don't say though is that I actually am making this up to sound more interesting because <span class="h3">I don't lie</span>. I can only imagine what you're thinking now, "This guy really is crazy! First he says he saw an alien then he says he doesn't lie! What next!" You can think whatever you want, but if you went up to anyone that knows me well, they could tell you that I don't lie and, for that matter, that I don't say bad words either which is sadly becoming increasingly common for everyone around me. Really, if you asked someone that knows me well if I lie (since I've had this come up before), they would say something like, "Well... ya. I remember when he said..." and if I was around I would say, "I didn't say that I said..." then they would say, "Oh ya. That's right." If they didn't say all of that they would say, "Ya." If I asked them to come up with one time that I did they would say, "... um ... I don't know, but there's no way that you've never lied," probably what you're thinking, but they can't deny that I'm honest and don't say bad words without them lying themselves. <span class="t5">A good example is this: not too long ago I came up with this funny thing where I would take something of someone's and hide it under their chair. When they realized it was gone (which it was more funny if I gave it back to them before they realized it was missing), they would say something like, "Did you steal my ____?" and I would say, "I don't have your ____." Notice I'm not lying because I really don't have their whatever. Besides, I don't really think it's stealing, it's more like misplacing. If they were to say, "Did you misplace my ____?" I would say, "Why is it that you just naturally assume that I did something with your ____?" I won't answer the question directly because I won't directly lie about my answer.</span> Staying true to the not lying streak though, there are a VERY VERY VERY VERY few times (notice how many "very"s there are) where it might depend on what your definition of lying is. I know what you're thinking, "Ha! I finally got him!" but no. It was only like twice, and, once again, it just <span style="text-decoration:underline">might depend on what your definition of lying is</span>. You can take that however you like, but, either way, I think it's pretty good that, out of 14 years, there are only 2 times that lying is in question. Also, I need the denial. If I ever accepted it, I would feel absolutely horrible about myself. I already feel bad enough about myself as it is. The point is that I don't lie to people, &amp; you can count on that. I would appreciate it if people didn't bring it up because it's meaningless, &amp; I would rather not think about it.
						</section>
						<section>
							Anyway, back to the story that I'm NOT lying about. When everyone came back outside, I told them about what happened and it seemed like they believed me with the same intensity that I believed their "sightings" ("I'm not too sure I believe you, and who really cares anyway if it didn't happen to me"). Although we kept searching after that, I'm pretty sure no one saw anything else, and the enthusiasm was lost. Soon, parents started coming to pick their kids up, and, eventually, I had to go home as well. The worst part of this is that, a few years later, I finally got a straight answer from p8 (who was with me when I saw the thing) about if he remembered it. He said no. I can only assume it's the same with everyone else at the sleepover. That <em class="elaborate">really</em> stinks because, if there's a bunch of people who say the same thing happened, you might believe them. If there's only one person who says something happened, you're probably going to think they're crazy. I probably shouldn't blame you; it's easy to understand why you would think I'm crazy, but I promise you, like I said earlier, this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. Don't discredit everything else I say because of this.
							<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/1/11">
								This is the first time I specifically indicate italics in my journal (by using a <span style="text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-style:wavy">squiggly underline</span> in the notebook since actually writing in italics is too difficult), and I can see that the word was originally capitalized but then erased and replaced with the italic version. I don't specifically remember the thought process anymore, but I'm almost certain that I was dissatisfied with using capitalization to indicate emphasis because I've always thought of it as being too strong of an indicator, so when I started needing to use it repeatedly due to the limitations of how distinct I could make my handwriting look, I got fed up with it and decided to come up with a way of implementing my own variety of italics. Although I did use to use capitalization for emphasis more frequently earlier in my life, based on my memory and the almost complete lack of emphasizing capitalization from this point forward, I'd say that I had largely progressed past that point by this time, and it's pretty much a guarantee that a significant amount of the capitalization writen prior to this point would've been written as italic instead if I had (presumably) settled on the method of indication earlier. However, I don't want to assume that I know what would've been italicized and what would've remained capitalized, so I've left the text as-written.

							In case you're wondering what I think of my alien encounter 10 and a half years later, I'll tell you that I definitely saw what I saw, but what exactly it was is anyone's guess. I've never been prone to drawing very unreasonable conclusions from my experiences, so when it comes to the idea that I was just a cute 7-year-old kid who let their imagination run away with them (which was obviously the opinion of my parents at the time), I throw that out right away. Although I still remember the incident (although not in nearly as much detail as this entry describes), I know better than to think my remaining memories are anything but what I've rehearsed in my head for years, so I can't go back to the original memory and try to extract any additional information while having the benefit of 17 additional years of experience. I'm not going to dismiss the idea that there's a totally reasonable explanation for what I saw, but my vision has worked just fine all my life, and I've never had a problem distinguishing an animal or person jogging up a hill from something more unusual; that was definitely something more unusual. That being said, had I witnessed this outside of the context of an alien hunt, I may have still thought it was strange and wondered about it for a little while, but I'm rather doubtful that I would've come to the conclusion that it was an alien. When it comes to my overall opinion on the existence of aliens, I think the universe is way too big for there to not be a single intelligent life form anywhere else, and if that life form knew about us, I'm sure it would be interested to learn more. Whether or not we've been visited by extraterrestrials is more debatable, and it's not uncommon that I think the accounts of alien encounters I hear about are just adults letting <em>their</em> imagination run away with them, but if the aliens had the technology to visit us, I wouldn't be particularly surprised to find out that they did. Wouldn't it be interesting if, at some point in the future, we made contact with an alien civilization which said that it did indeed visit us in secret in the past, and upon inspection of their logs, it was discovered that they stopped by Missouri 17 years ago and had a hard time completing their objectives because they were busy dodging a bunch of kids. Until such a time, however, I don't think we're going to get any closer to settling the dispute over exactly what I saw.

					<section class="t26" id="jumpRopeForHeartStory" data-coolness="3">
						I can't believe I forgot about one of the best days in my life. Every year, the school would have a day of doing active activities such as jump roping, hula hooping (I can't remember for sure), and tug-of-war. One of the main events was the Jump Rope For Heart (which the day might have also been called). At that time, everyone who wanted to participate would get a jump rope and see who could jump the longest (maybe this wasn't a whole day thing because I'm pretty sure only one grade was in the gym at a time). In third grade I was doing great. People tripped up one by one until only me and one other person (p9) were left. After this went on for a while, slowly, people started cheering my name! The next thing I know, all of third grade is cheering for me! I actually feel bad for p9; it would really stink if I was jumping and everyone started cheering my competitor's name, but it's not like I wish it didn't happen. A while later, p9 finally slipped up and I was the champion! I didn't stop there though. The previous record was 14 minutes and something and I made <span class="elaborate">the record</span> 16 minutes and something! I went on so long that they made me move so they could start tug-of-war. Much later though, I was criticized for jumping too slow which I was jumping pretty slow, but I never had a chance to redeem myself because that was the last year they did the traditional Jump Rope For Heart. On a side note, I wish I could remember the seconds of my record &amp; the previous one like I did for a long time.
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/1/14" data-heading="Explanation">
							I was purposefully vague with "the record" here because I wasn't sure exactly which record I broke: After I set "the record", the teacher(s) made a point of telling me that I set the district record rather than just the school record, but I could never believe that a third grader could out-jump a high schooler, so I always felt like I missed something. I tossed around the idea that I might've broken the record for all elementary schools in the district or something, but I never got any clarification.

						When it was time for me to go to middle school, I went to the school district closer to where we lived. If you're paying attention, you'll have noticed that I'm referring to the house in the past tense, but I'm not there yet.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, so starts my middle school years.
					</section>
					<section>
						For one thing, I had to get up an hour earlier than I was used to (&asymp;7:00am) which was torture. The first day on the bus was weird because I hadn't riden a bus except for field trips for years because p2 drove me to school. I want to say it was like a dream, but that's corny &amp; there's probably a better way to describe it that I just can't think of. The point is, it felt strange.
					</section>
					<section class="t6">
						A strong theme throughout middle school is excessive time being spent on homework. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the time I spent doing homework wasn't lengthened by me at all, but, based on how much homework &amp; free time I have in high school, a large portion of it was the school's fault. It was miserable. Long breaks &amp; sometimes weekends were pretty much the only times I could escape homework's grip. I think that, somewhat because of this, I have problems with medium amounts of homework because I have all sorts of practice with tons of homework, &amp; anyone can deal with small amounts of homework, but I don't know how to budget my time for medium amounts of homework. I'm not using it as an excuse not to try, but I'd rather not have this problem (but it's better than dealing with the problem of too much homework).
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						Luckily, there are many good things that happened in middle school. Something I enjoyed was joining band. We would perform at places (usually the high school), &amp; it was fun. I played the trumpet, but next year we could switch to the french horn which I did. I can almost guarantee that I still have my trumpet by the time you read this (assuming I'm still alive) because we had to buy it &amp; I see no reason to get rid of it (the french horns are school instruments).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something I thought about early in middle school is how no one stands in lines to go anywhere. At first I thought it was kind-of rude, but really, what else are you going to do? <span class="elaborate obvious afterthought" data-date="2023/2/5">Elaboration</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/2/5" data-heading="Elaboration">
							During elementary school, the absence of a line while the class was going through the hallways was evidence of kids misbehaving and dispersing the line that should exist. However, in middle school, no one stays with the same people anymore, so you have to disperse in order to go to your separate classes.
						</aside>
						<span class="afterthought">I thought it was crazy how quickly everyone adjusted to middle school procedures, though: Even in the very first class on the very first day, the moment the bell rang, everyone instantly got up and piled through the door. In the meantime, I was still at my seat waiting for the teacher to finish their train of thought and then tell us it was time to get into a line to go.</span> Eventually I got over it.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/14">
						Another interesting change I noticed going into middle school was the attitude towards girls. Throughout all of my life leading up to middle school, everyone was in agreement that girls had cooties (or were gross or lame or whatever, "cooties" wasn't actually used much), but abruptly after middle school, you were suddenly immature if you thought girls had cooties. I never really understood why girls were supposed to have cooties in the first place because they seemed to be just like everyone else <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>, but with classmates and adults alike frequently referencing it, I figured I'd just go along with it.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="none">
							I did think girls were kind-of lame, but that was primarily because they generally didn't like videogames or play outside; I didn't think there was an inherent quality of girls which made them undesirable. Furthermore, I recognized that there was a good chance that girls were being lame because they felt like they <em>shouldn't</em> like videogames or play outside because that stuff isn't lady-like (much like how I felt like I shouldn't cry when I got hurt because that isn't manly). As society decreases the expectation that people fit into traditional gender roles (much like how videogames are definitely no longer thought of as being only for boys), it may be that there will be less reason for a young me to think that girls are lame at all, but this was the situation at the time.
						</aside>
						Since the idea girls had cooties, for me, was based on experienced expectations rather than my own opinion, I saw no reason to not continue making jokes about it in middle school, but when I saw that those jokes were almost universally failing, I decided that people had completely changed their minds on the topic in less than a year <span class="elaborate">for no apparent reason</span>, and so I adapted again to fit the expectations of those around me which now actually more closely aligned to my original thoughts.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="none">
							Okay, there was the obvious reason of people experiencing hormonal changes as they got older, but that was never a factor for me when determining who to make friends with <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>,
							<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Insistence" data-date="2023/6/17">
								I doubt many people at all believe that statement, but I stand by it. I won't discount a potential subtle influence in some situations, but my establishment of friends is based much more on who's around and what personality they have, especially in middle school. If you were to point out the lack of female friends in elementary school, I would attribute it to the social expectations (which aren't based on hormones, or at least mine), and I would furthermore point out how I actually did have a few female friends in Spectra where we were all forced to work together and ignore who may or may not have cooties. Much later, I actually go to great lengths to determine what may be influencing my friendships with boys and girls.
							</aside>
							so I didn't understand why it was for anyone else, and even with that reason in mind, it still didn't explain the stark contrast between elementary school and middle school. Not everyone is going to experience hormonal changes at the same time, so the change should be gradual if that was the only influence. It could be that the idea of the next level of schooling made people feel like they should establish a more mature outlook on the world, but <span class="elaborate">random life events without direct relevance</span> have never changed my opinions or personality, so I don't understand why they would for other people. It didn't make any sense then, and it doesn't make any sense now, but whatever.
							<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/6/18">
								Some people may consider going into middle school to be more than just a random life event without direct relevance, but even when taking into account the fact that it was a different school district, that's all I felt like it was. For me, in order to instill a sense that I need to become more mature for instance (which would never happen because I was always the mature one in my grade), I would need people to express an expectation that I should be more mature or I would need to observe that my current maturity level isn't allowing me to be as successful in life as I'd like to be. Both of those things are directly related to the behavior of interest whereas going up one more grade level in school yet again seems loosely associated at best. If the things I mentioned came along with moving up a grade level for whatever reason, it may be that I do change in that next year, but it would be because of those things and not because of the routine and independent occurrence of reaching a higher academic level. Aside from what I already mentioned, my opinions and personality were largely unchanged between elementary school and middle school.
							</aside>
						</aside>
						Because of this change in myself and the newly dissolved social barrier between boys and girls, the likelihood of me becoming friends with girls was greatly increased (although I still felt kind-of awkward about it for a long time).

						Not much happened in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, but in 7<sup>th</sup> grade there was (&amp; maybe still is) this thing called Medieval Day. People would come to school in medieval costumes &amp; then the whole day we did awesome stuff in the large gym. Earlier, we signed up for events to participate in. Throughout the day, we would do these events, &amp; you could really get into it. To help you understand who was versing each other &amp; who won, I need to say this: each grade level was divided into four "teams" (I guess to help order classes or something). Only 7<sup>th</sup> grade had Medieval Day so there were 4 teams competing. The teams of the school were named by the grade number dash either 1, 2, 3, or 4. I was in 7-4 (in the other 2 years I was in 6-4 &amp; 8-2). On Medieval Day, there was one team, either 7-1 or 7-2, that was losing by a long shot. It was funny though; once they figured they had absolutely no chance of winning, they started cheering really enthusiastically. You wouldn't have known they were losing if you weren't keeping track of the score. I think anyone else would've done the same; if you're going to lose, lose by a lot. The other teams, though, did not lose by a lot. In the end, it came down to the last event to determine 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup>. I think it was called "peasant plow". One person would be on this circular rolly thing while another person would hold on to their shoulders &amp; push them. They would go a certain distance, around a cone, then come back. It was like a relay. There was probably more to the rules than that, but that's the main idea. For the first few times back &amp; forth, no one could tell who was going to win. In the last time, though, my team pulled ahead &amp; we won! Whoo hoo!
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/2/5">
						I have a really good memory, but not everything sticks with me for a ridiculously long time, and some of these memories in particular are getting quite old. With the exception of one moment of us rattling the building with our screams during the final event (most likely), I didn't really remember Medieval Day at all. As I was typing up what I had written down, I was surprised to discover that the day existed at all, and although I didn't think we lost, I really had no idea what was going to happen. This is the kind of stuff you can't get from an autobiography. No recollection of my entire life after I become rich and famous is going to have much, if any, of these entertaining little glimpses into my life, especially my early life, and even important moments are likely to end up understated as I inevitably shift my priorities. Although it ends up leaving you with much more to read, I'm really happy I did things this way.
					</section>
					<section>
						There is another memory I have that's not really from 7<sup>th</sup> grade but involves someone from then. It's not that happy, but don't worry, happy memories are to come. <span class="person p12">My 7<sup>th</sup> grade math teacher</span> was awesome. My other teachers are usually pretty good too, but he was one of the better ones. Rather than handing stuff to us he would throw it to us &amp; hope we could catch. He liked to joke around &amp; was pretty nice. He was a volunteer firefighter &amp; told us all sorts of stories from his experiences. However, the summer after 8<sup>th</sup> grade, my opinion of him changed. I was told by p11.firstName &amp; others in my culd-e-sac that he was arrested. They said that he was found to be in possession of an inappropriate picture of a student. At first, I wasn't sure if I believed them; they tended to exaggerate things &amp; he seemed too nice for him to do something like that. Later, though, I heard something else about him on the news which made me believe. There was this thing that this school district did called 5<sup>th</sup> grade camp. For a week, all 5<sup>th</sup> graders would go to some camp site &amp; do stuff while learning. <span class="person p12">My teacher</span> was one of the people who helped there. At some point you must have to change for something because, apparently, my teacher offered to let everyone change in his room for more privacy &amp; then he video taped it secretly. It's hard for me to understand why he would do that. He was so nice, why ruin it?
					</section>
					<section>
						Now to those good memories I was talking about. In 8<sup>th</sup> grade there were a few fun things that happened.
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						One thing was when one of the 2 band teachers, p13, got teacher of the year. p14 (p14.pronunciation.lastName), the other band teacher, told us about it when she wasn't around. He gave a bunch of us a large letter, &amp; when p13 came back, p14 had us "show her the changes made to (whatever song it was)". I <em>really</em> wish someone was videotaping p13's reaction. When she first started conducting, she seemed like she was having a hard day. It might have been just me, but that's what it seemed like. When we started holding up the letters (one at a time), she looked confused. Once enough letters were up to tell what it said, p13's face got really red &amp; she started smiling &amp; laughing. I think the message was "CONGRATULATIONS p13.string.toUpperCase! TEACHER OF THE YEAR!" Afterwards, I think we all got cake.
					</section>
					<section class="t7" data-coolness="1">
						While on the subject of band, I remember something else that's funny. Although I really didn't see anything happen, just the thought of it makes me laugh. Apparently there was a rivalry between the band teachers &amp; someone in the office. From what I heard, the band teachers borrowed some scissors (which I don't get because I think they had some). When it was time to give them back, they put them in some Jello &amp; sent someone to give them back. Ever since that happened, I've wanted to do that. I can't remember for sure, but the person in the office might have given the band teachers something in Jello afterwards.

						<section class="t8">
							Another prominent aspect of my time in middle school (and in general) is my development of codes. I always thought it was cool to have a secret writing system, so sometime in elementary school, I made my first code by adding things to the letters of English to obscure their original form. (I called this code <span data-revisit="check spelling">Adibri</span>.) That code served me for a time, but I was never satisfied with the degree to which I was able to hide the letters, and I was especially disappointed one day when p2 was able to largely read my encoded message despite never having been taught how to decode it. In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I decided it was time for an upgrade, and on October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I began putting together a more indecipherable code called Shayleig. I know the exact date because I could see when I started mapping letters to the symbols in my school planner. I may have finished creating the code by the 15<sup>th</sup>, but I'd have to check the planner again to be sure because I apparently didn't take good enough notes on what I saw, so I don't know what I meant by "lowercase, #ssuicid." on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. Like my old code, this code had symbols for both uppercase and lowercase letters (since it wouldn't be complete without it), but I roughly based the symbols off of the ends and intersections of lines in English letters, so it was much more difficult if not impossible to make a connection between the design of the symbol and what letter it corresponded to. Over time, I've made many more codes exploring different methods of encryption, but Shayleig was my go-to code. I slowly made improvements over the years, but this code was sufficiently cryptic that I used it heavily (most frequently in my planner or in the margins of school work when I had time), and I got great pleasure from doing so, especially when someone else couldn't figure out what I was saying. Since some people somehow think it's possible that I was so lame that I would need to reference a key to write my code, let me just clarify by saying that, except for a very short time at the beginning, I had Shayleig memorized, and to this day (June 8, 2023), I can still read it without a key. <span class="elaborate obvious">Extra information</span>
							<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/8" data-heading="Extra information">
								I have noticed my knowledge of the code slowly deteriorating because I can't type the code, and I've almost exclusively typed for years now, so it's getting a little harder for me to remember what the symbols are for the most recent revision of the code, but I can still get through reading it without a problem, and back in the day, I could read it almost as fast as normal letters and words.
							</aside>
						</section>
						<div class="t7 t8" id="originOfTheCode" data-coolness="2">
							<section>
								Naturally, a code is no fun if you can't confuse people with it, so it wasn't uncommon for me to write encrypted messages to people, and among those people were the band teachers. Band was always a less structured and more inviting class than my other classes, so I felt more empowered to do weird things. On or around December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I used my go-to code Shayleig to write my first encoded message to the band teachers. ("It's amazing you accually solved this") You'll notice how I use the word "first" because that was far from the only encoded message I gave them. At fairly regular intervals, I would ask about their progress on deciphering the code, and whenever I decided they needed more incentive to figure it out, I would give them another encoded message. Sometimes, the reason I would give them another message would be because they would claim that they had deciphered my message(s), but based on how they refused to provide any proof of doing so (like saying what the message said), I figured they were just trying to get me to quit <span class="elaborate">nagging them</span>, so I would write a new message which they invariably couldn't read.
								<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
									Okay, let's just be clear here that, although I was persistent, I tried to make sure I didn't become a bother. There were some days when the band teachers didn't seem like they were having a good time, so I would let it go, and even when I was prompting them to work on my code, I put effort into making sure I didn't push so hard that it wasn't fun anymore. I may not have let them forget about my code, but to the best of my ability, I only did so in a way that didn't create a true irritation for them.
								</aside>
								This sort of thing would also happen when they claimed to have lost the message. (It may be that all additional messages had a specific reason to be written, and I just don't remember anymore.) The band teachers had no shortage of excuses about why they weren't getting anywhere, and despite my frequent prompting, this continued for quite a long time. Since those were the only two band teachers for the whole middle school (and I took band through all of middle school), I had them as my teachers for the next two years, and the saga of my encoded messages continued throughout that time. Somewhere along the line, I decided to occasionally write encoded messages on the white board before class as another means of keeping my code at the forefront of their minds (and perhaps also as a means of decreasing direct nagging), but it made little difference.
							</section>
							<section>
								Towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, though, there was a major development. Leading up to this time, p13 had started taking over as the one who seemed like they may actually solve my code one day, and with the end of my middle school career approaching, she was running out of time. Towards the end of the year, though, she claimed that she had figured out my code. Considering how I had heard this story before, I wasn't very keen to believe it, and naturally, she had "forgotten" the code stuff at home, so she couldn't provide proof; however, she did seem a little more insistant than during previous claims of success. Still doubtful, I proceeded to write an encoded message on the white board, and as I was writing it, p13 was correctly reading to me what I was writing. It may have taken 2.5 years, but she had actually deciphered my code. That wasn't the end of the story, though.
							</section>
							<section>
								<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/things/papers/The Code enhanced.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
								Having endured years of pestering about solving my code, p13 wasn't satisfied with just figuring out what my messages said; she needed to find a way to try to get back at me. As such, she made her own encoded message which she tasked me with deciphering. I vowed to conquer her code, but with the end of the year so near, there was other stuff going on and not much time for me to demonstrate my victory to her. I wasn't able to find a solution before I graduated from middle school, but I refused to be beaten, and I continued to work on it afterwards. What I inevitably discovered, though, was that there wasn't enough context for me to work with: When approaching the decryption of codes, it's typically helpful to use the frequency of appearance of certain symbols to guide your guesses of the correct letter. Moreover, you can use the placement of symbols within words (assuming the spaces are obvious) to help eliminate some potential options. With the code p13 provided, the spaces were obvious, but there were only 4 words. If you were to arbitrarily assign a unique letter to each unique symbol (besides the exclamation point and what's obviously a space), the message would be "abcde fgh ij kflme!" A frequency analysis with 4 words is completely meaningless, and there are very few opportunities to narrow down potential options based on symbol placement. To worsen the situation, it was possible that the first symbol was a capital with a different symbol from its lowercase equivalent since she may have wanted to provide me with the same level of difficulty as my own code. That isn't a problem if the letter isn't used elsewhere, but it becomes a significant problem if one of the other letters is the same as the first one. I spent a lot of time trying to systematically eliminate possible symbol decryptions, and I racked my brain for possible word combinations that would make sense in this context, but there are just too many words, so I couldn't go through every possiblity, and I couldn't narrow down what letters never appear in a certain place in a word very well at all. I could've gone through the dictionary and kept track of how every word might fit into the code, but that would've taken months if not years of intense work, and I still might not have been able to get the information that I needed. With seemingly insurmountable obstacles surrounding me on all sides, I reluctantly had to set the code aside... for a while, that is...

							In other code-related news, the band teachers weren't the only teachers I gave an encoded message to. Although it was much later and didn't become nearly as much of an ordeal, I also gave a message to my <span class="elaborate">G.A.T.E.</span> teacher, p15.<aside data-heading="Acronym">Gifted And Talented Education</aside> I don't remember the exact timeline anymore (although it may be hidden in my school planner), but this was towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and in about a week (definitely less than a month, maybe as little as a few days), she had deciphered my code, and what really got me was that she even pointed out a few spelling and grammar errors I made. Since this happened after p13 had solved my code, I made mention of how p15 would be doing better than the band teachers if she figured out my code in less than 3 years, and when she did, she questioned whether it really took the band teachers 3 years, but as you now know yourself, that was hardly an exaggeration.

						Another good 8<sup>th</sup> grade experience is something that happened in G.A.T.E. class (Gifted And Talented Education). It was getting towards the end of the year &amp; usually everyone in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade class would give something to the teacher, p15, before they left for high school. At first it was something like a picture with a little extra then it upgraded to a ceiling tile, one of the ceiling tiles even had gulible written on it so someone could really say, "gulible's written on the ceiling." Each year, the gift got better. That was no exception for us. One day I got a letter in school asking me to give $<span data-currency="USD">8</span> to get something for p15 (it said what it was going to be, but I want to surprise you).

						A last, significant memory of middle school is of the "8<sup>th</sup> grade outing". The 8<sup>th</sup> grade outing is pretty much a free day at the end of the year where we get to do fun stuff. For a good majority of the day, we just stood around outside with our yearbooks &amp; a few things from the gym to do stuff with. That's not the interesting part. One cool thing of the day was that we got pizza and Gatorade for lunch. Throughout the course of the day, before we all went inside, I was obviously talking &amp; walking with some friends of mine. Since the whole 8<sup>th</sup> grade was there, I got to see some of their friends. As I thought about these friends of friends, I began to think about my friends &amp; what they were like as well. It was that day I realized how much of an outsider I was (&amp; am). When I saw how strange they were &amp; was spurred into thinking back &amp; realizing how strange they were, it finally hit me that I'm more of an outsider than I thought. I don't mean strange in a necessarily bad way, but they were certainly contrasting to normal. I never really thought of myself as much of an outsider, just a more reserved person. It's not that big of a deal though. It's not like I'm treated much different from everyone else.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, back to the 8<sup>th</sup> grade outing. After a ridiculous amount of time sitting outside doing nothing, everyone started going inside &amp; I wanted to see what was going on. I think the 3 things that happened were in this order, but don't hold me to it.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="1">
						As I was walking in I heard some music. When I looked to see where it was coming from I saw Finally Friday playing it. It will be cool if they become some big-time band in the future, but I'll explain just in case. For each of the past talent shows a few people from my grade came together &amp; played music. It's the general concensus that they're good including my opinion. I guess because everyone liked them &amp; they didn't have to be paid, the teachers decided to have them play. There were at least 2 times that they finished playing, but were told they could play one more song. It was seriously like a rock concert in there except with less people.
					</section>
					<section>
						Next, there was an inspirational speaker who was funny.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="3">
						The last thing no one knew was going to happen. The <span class="person p16">8<sup>th</sup> grade principal</span> said that there was a special award to be given to someone. She said the person getting it was p17 (p17.pronunciation.lastName, as in ouch), my 8<sup>th</sup> grade math teacher. They still hadn't said what she had won when I heard screaming (like when a movie star walks into someplace). I looked to see what was going on, &amp; when the person came into my view, who do I see but p17's <span class="person p18">boyfriend</span> in a nice suit walking towards her. By then everyone knew what was going on, &amp; p17 looked like she was about to pass out &amp; explode with happiness at the same time. When her boyfriend got up there, he got down on 1 knee &amp; proposed. She could hardly say anything, but I saw her head nod. Right after that, I think he put the ring on (he must have, but I don't remember it specifically) &amp; then went to a microphone &amp; said, "Oh my gosh, she said yes!" There was all sorts of cheering. I guess she'll be Mrs. p17.marriedName soon.
					</section>
					<section>
						After all of that, we got slushies. It was an awesome day.
					</section>
					<section>
						I could tell you more about the people in middle school, but that would take forever. You can get your fill of drama (not that I'm in much) from high school.
					</section>
					<div class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/14">
						<section>
							Let's give it a shot, though. I'll give a brief overview:
						</section>
						<section> <!-- The <section> helps the list get assigned an ID for linking. -->
							<ul>
								<li>
									One of the first people I got to know was p19. He was a very calm person and was in band with me.
								</li>
								<li>
									p20 and p21 were frequently in my company, and they, especially, were the ones with the strange friends who helped me realize what an outsider I was. They (along with others as it became popular) would frequenly steal my lunch when we sat together at the lunch table (especially p21), but I knew they were just taking joking around too far, and I'd usually get it back, so I could mostly get over it. Once or twice, something of mine was taken and then either thrown away or eaten, and that didn't go over well with me at all, so that never became much of an issue. After a while, I started licking all of the stuff in my lunch bag so they wouldn't want to touch it, but in time, they stopped caring about that. Towards the end of middle school, though, through some combination of them getting bored with it and me getting fed up with it, the instances of lunch theft decreased.
								</li>
								<li>
									p22 p22.lastName was someone who I primarily saw at lunch (with p20 and p21 and others), and unlike the others, he was calm, thought about things more deeply, and didn't steal my lunch.
								</li>
								<li>
									p23 and p24 were two people in a lot of my classes (including G.A.T.E.), and they were pretty nice. p23 was quite calm whereas p24 had a lot of energy to expend. They had a rivalry between each other which was plainly started by p24, but p23 would play along, and they'd have fun. p24 was in band with me whereas p23 was a loser in orchestra (although percussion would often get shared with orchestra, so p24 was often in orchestra as well). Both of them played instruments in the band Finally Friday (p24 on drums and p23 on guitar), while the singer was someone I would see around but didn't really know (p25). p24 was the only person I knew to be in a relationship (not with p25) and seem to take it seriously. I was secretly jealous of p24 and p23 because they were in a (more) advanced math class which I felt more than capable of taking on, but because I had to rely on the slow rate of teaching to increase my math knowledge, I could never catch up to the higher grade level of math that they were at. (They were the only two people in my grade who were taking the math classes of the next grade up.) I always found it to be an interesting coincidence that p23 and p24 became rather close friends because they have very similar last names (p23.lastName and p24.lastName).
								</li>
								<li>
									p26 p26.lastName and p27 were basically the class clowns. They were very out-going and were quick to make a joke about anything. They thoroughly enjoyed being partners in crime, but they were generally good about making sure they didn't take things too far. p26 was in G.A.T.E. with me, but I don't think p27 was (although we did share the advanced math class). Something I found amusing that stuck with me was, a few times when one of their jokes would fall flat with the class, they would pick up the hand of the other person to high five it and pretend like that signified the support of at least one other person in the class.
								</li>
								<li>
									p28 rode my bus (and was in my grade) and was kind-of crazy. Some common topics that came up with him were butter toast, eating children, and Vietnam (he wasn't Asian). While in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, we both had the same <span class="person p29">science teacher</span> at different times of day, and he would complain about her all the time (often lightheartedly). One day, I spilled p28's secrets to the teacher, and later on, p28 told me a great story about how she called him out and embarassed him in class. Ah, memories. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span>
									<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
										Okay, I'm not a monster: The stuff he complained about wasn't all that serious, and the way he was embarassed wasn't the end of the world. <span class="h-o2">Although he was plainly traumatized from the experience,</span> he was smiling as he recounted the horror I put him through.
									</aside>
								</li>
								<li>
									p30, p31, and p32 were my fellow French horn players, so we would sit next to each other and talk about things frequently. I can't quite remember anymore, but I'm pretty sure that p31 was in G.A.T.E. and that it was him who coordinated the gift of the <span class="p15" data-use="lastName.string.toUpperCase"></span>INATOR sign. p32 thought it would be fun to call me a nickname, so she would occasionally refer to me as "Roberto", but she later decided that "Roberto" was too long, so she shortened it to "Bird Toe". In response, I would occasionally refer to her as something like "p32.extra1".
								</li>
								<li>
									p33 was fairly out-going, and she had this strange tendency to frequently tell me how I had long eyelashes. Later on, I found out that she would tell p19 that he had "beautiful eyebrows", and when I commented on that to her, she tried out saying that to me as well, but it never gained much traction.
								</li>
							</ul>

					<section>
						However, there's one thing I want to tell you that I think is interesting. When going from middle school to this high school, miles away from the previous school district, I've noticed a few people with personalities remarkably similar to people I knew. Also, some people look uncannily like other people I knew. It's weird.
					</section>
					<section>
						There are 2 main important things that happened at home during my middle school years, one of which led to a 3<sup>rd</sup>.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/Shawny holding me.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:12em">
						The first of these things explains when I said, "I don't really have any siblings, but I'll get into that later." This is later. I remember p1 saying a few times that I may have a sister. Now you're probably thinking, "What do you mean by that?" Well, years &amp; years ago, apparently p1 liked <span class="person p34">some girl</span> a little too much, &amp; later she had a baby under suspicious circumstances. P1 brought it up with her, but she wasn't very helpful, &amp; although he tried, p1 didn't have enough money to pursue it in depth. A few years ago, p1 somehow found someone on Facebook who was friends with p35.firstName p35.lastName, what he thought her name was (the kid). Eventually he got a hold of her &amp; it seemed like she was the right person. He waited until she was 18 (which was only a few months) <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/17">(This would put the events at happening in mid- to late-2008, so the end of grade school.)</span> &amp; had a DNA test done. He waited so he wouldn't have to pay back child support. We never really had or have much money, but we're not really poor; we just have to be careful with money. The test came out something like 99.98% positive, so I'd say p1 was right. We all met up soon after that in some restaurant. She brought <span class="p0">her uncle</span> along which is reasonable. At later times, we went (without her uncle) to various places.
					</section>
					<section class="t10">
						However, life couldn't be easy. Mostly through phone calls &amp; e-mail, things started taking a wrong turn. For one thing, p1 wanted to see her a whole lot, but I'm not sure if that would have been enough to run it bad. The main thing was how, apparently, p1 has been holding a grudge against <span class="person p34">her mom</span>. He was really upset that she made it so difficult to get to p35, &amp; he made sure to tell p35 that she was the reason he hadn't been around for all that time. I don't know about you, but if someone I didn't know very well just came up to me &amp; told me the parent I've lived with all my life was a horrible person, that wouldn't go over well with me very well. The same happened with her, but p1 thinks he has to bring it up to defend himself which makes sense, but if one thing doesn't work, TRY SOMETHING ELSE! He now has a grudge against her. It affects him a lot, &amp; you can tell it must go through his head a few times a day at least. One day, when I have my own house &amp; at least a small reason to go, I'll find p35 &amp; fix all of this. I don't think she has much of a problem with me. Until then, all I can do is hope things get better.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I look back at the beginning of this autobiography, I want to change "don't really have any siblings" to "have a half-sister", but I'm trying not to change much, so you can see how I progress as a person. The reason I would say that in the first place is because it's weird to just suddenly include someone in your family that you weren't even sure existed for about 11 years of your life &amp; then don't really see much of afterwards.
					</section>
					<section>
						The second thing that happened at home during middle school isn't very happy either.
					</section>
					<section>
						When we moved to the house we lived in at the time, we still had the old house to pay for because it hadn't been sold yet. That continued to drain our money until it finally sold. I think it was bought by the mayor &amp; was eventually turned into a wine &amp; cheese shop. At some point, I'm going to figure out what it's called. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(<a href="https://www.cottlevillewineseller.com/">The Cottleville Wine Seller.</a>)</span> After all of this, we needed to sell something else.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Mom and me walking in the farm creek.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/me/First baby alpaca.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						We used to own a place in Winfield, Missouri, that was out in the woods &amp; was paid off. We called it The Farm, but don't get the wrong idea, <span class="elaborate">it wasn't a farm</span>.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Concession" data-date="2023/6/23">
							Okay, you could make an argument that it was a livestock farm for alpacas, but when I think of a farm, I think of large open areas for growing crops or for allowing the grazing of a large number of animals, not a primarily wooded area on a relatively steep hill home to a few domesticated animals. We were directly adjacent to a farm, but to me, this property was just a cool place in the woods that happened to have some alpacas on it.
						</aside>
						It doesn't make much sense why we called it that, but that's not the point. It had an open area, a stream, a huge hill through the woods open on top, &amp; a lake. I didn't like it getting sold, but I moved on. I can't remember exactly when we sold it, so there might have been other factors that went into selling it <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(such as the neighbor's dogs killing all of the alpacas)</span>. In the end, though, it didn't save us. The idea was, we were close to paying off the newer house, &amp; if we had a little more money, we could do it. P1 was told that the stock market had never been lower, so he should put his money in, &amp; he could make the money he wanted. If you know about this period in time, you can see where this is going <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(although I wouldn't)</span>. P1 thought it was a pretty good idea, so he put it in. He wasn't experienced with it, but I don't think that would have mattered much. It just went downhill from there. The stock market didn't go back up after being low; it just went further down. This continued until we had pretty much nothing left. Real estate wasn't going well for p1, &amp; p2 didn't make enough money to support all of us.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/West Evergreen house.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						This led to us needing to move. We looked all over the place, but all of the inexpensive houses weren't very appealing. We almost got one that wouldn't have been too bad &amp; would have been in the same school district, but that fell through. Eventually, we came across our current house at 2368 West Evergreen Drive, Pacific, Missouri. My first thought when I heard what city it was in was, "What genius names a city after an ocean?!" Anyway, the house is 2 stories &amp; is near the top of a large hill.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/things/Awesome pine tree.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:10em">
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/View from pine tree.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:14em">
						There's a lot of woods behind the house, a huge pine tree in the front that literally seems to be made for climbing, neighbors a fairly short distance away, &amp; down the street, there's a huge lake. There are some drawbacks, though. There's no basement, mice, water damage, &amp; evidence to support termites being in one wall. The biggest problem, I'd say, is mold. We looked at this awhile before getting it, &amp; in the spring, you could really tell it was going to be an issue. You can't really see it very easily, &amp; it may be in only one room, but in the spring you could definitely smell it. It was <em>horrible</em>. I'm guessing over the summer it dried up, &amp; we somehow lucked out over the fall until it's too cold, but it's still there. Spring is only one season away, &amp; we need to make sure it's gone before it comes back to life. Just so you know, we moved here over the summer. We thought our old house would be foreclosed on, but at the very last second, someone bought it. We didn't get any money off of it, but our debts got paid. Also in case you're wondering, the house we bought was something around $<span data-currency="USD">20,000</span>. Where did we get the money? P2 has an aunt that had an inheritance for her. We persuaded her to give it to us early.
					</section>
					<section>
						And so ends the middle school portion of my life. The high school part has begun only recently, but I'll go more into detail.
					</section>
					<section>
						Over the summer, a little before school, the band has "Band Camp". It's not really a camp. Every morning, for 2 weeks, I had to get up ridiculously early (about 6:00am, which turns out to be about when I need to get up to get to school), &amp; get to the school band room. I found it the first time by following other people. At the beginning, we spent most of our time outside, behind the school, working on "the show" (the pictures to make on the football field) in the scorching heat. Later, we started working more inside on music. At the end of the 2 weeks, we performed it for our parents.
					</section>
					<section>
						Closer to the beginning of school, I had to be registered. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(Yes, I was killing myself in band before I was even officially registered to be a student there.)</span> I got to see where my classes were, so I wasn't so lost, &amp; I even got to pick my locker. P1 got frustrated that I took so long to pick my locker &amp; especially when I didn't pick what he thought would be best. I think my choice ended up being the best because I don't have to worry about people directly to my left or right, &amp; a big group of people gather right in front of where the other locker would have been.
					</section>
					<section class="t11">
						The first day of school was certainly interesting. For one thing, no one was at the bus stop, &amp; it was strange being in a completely different place. When I got nervous was when the bus stopped at a school that wasn't the high school. I started freaking out, but then I noticed not everyone got off. I didn't understand what was going on, but calmed down for the time being. That didn't last long. I got even more nervous than before when the bus stopped for a second time at a school that wasn't the high school. I looked around, &amp; still not everyone was getting off. I was <em>really</em> hoping everyone knew what they were doing. At the third &amp; final stop, we arrived at the high school. My blood pressure finally returned to normal, &amp; I got off the bus. It takes about 30 minutes to get to &amp; from school. The rest of the school day progressed just about the same as any other first one of the year. However, I ran into problems with the bus again. Since I had never riden that bus before, I didn't know what number it was. I went to the office to find out, &amp; they said it was number 9. When I went to get on, I noticed it was <span class="p0">a different bus driver</span>. When I brought it up, she said she was a substitute. After she saw I was still unsure, she asked where I lived. I told her West Evergreen, but I didn't really know any more of the address. She said she delivered to Evergreen, &amp; I thought, "How many Evergreens could there possibly be, &amp; besides, the office told me it was this bus." Apparently, there could be 3 Evergreens. I didn't really know the bus route, so I didn't realize I was on the wrong bus until we arrived at a big sign that said, "Evergreen" that wasn't where I lived. There was only one stop left, &amp; then the bus driver had me go to the front, &amp; I gave her a description of where I lived. I guess she had other places to go because she dropped me off at an elementary school <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">where I was met by <span class="person p36">one of the high school band teachers</span></span>, &amp; another bus came to take me home. It turns out I was supposed to ride bus 2. I still don't know why the office told me the wrong number.
					</section>
					<section>
						The bus ride was confusing &amp; inconsistent for a long time, but it eventually worked itself out. The bus stops at 3 places because there's apparently so few people that they all get piled into one bus &amp; still have a bunch of room left over. The first stop is a middle school for 6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> grade. The next stop is a school called Riverbend for 8<sup>th</sup> grade. The last stop is, like I said, the high school. On the way back home, it's in reverse. When I wondered what was going on with Riverbend &amp; why there wasn't a middle school with 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> grade, I was told that Riverbend was newly built to accommodate an increasing amount of students, &amp; 2 school areas were arguing over who would get the new stuff. Eventually, they decided they both could have it by making the middle schools only 6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> grade &amp; having the 8<sup>th</sup> grade go there.
					</section>
					<section>
						Returning to my classes, something got messed up in my schedule during registration: Social Studies was left out. When I discovered this, I had to figure out which class I was going to replace. After much thought &amp; deliberation, I decided to take my one year of <span class="elaborate">P.E.</span> next year. <aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25" data-heading="Acronym">Physical Education. This is how it had always been refered to throughout my time in school.</aside> I have Band, Explorations, Science, Academic Advisory, Communication Arts, Spanish, Math, &amp; Social Studies. Academic Advisory is a class where everyone just gets to work on homework. It's awesome. Explorations is a class for gifted students. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">Explorations is the class I was strongly considering giving up insead of P.E. since that type of class had never seemed to provide much practical value to me, but I wanted to give it a shot, and I strongly suspected that I wouldn't make room for the class in future years.</span> On Mondays, we have all our classes except 4<sup>th</sup> hour (Academic Advisory). The classes are 47 minutes long. On Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays we have odd classes, &amp; on Wednesdays &amp; Fridays we have even classes. The classes are an hour &amp; a half. School starts off at 7:30 &amp; ends at 2:20. None of the clocks are synchronized, so it's useless to attempt to see if your're running late to a class or on time. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">There were also actual metal bells that rang between the classes rather than a tone broadcast over the intercom.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t11 t12">
						My first day in Explorations was weird. It's not like now it's any different; I've just gotten used to it. When I walked in &amp; sat down, I thought there couldn't be that few of people. Yes there could. After the bell rang, the grand total was 8, including myself, with no one missing. Another thing is that they're all girls (not including myself). I later found out that they're all Sophmores. Isn't that fun. Depending on what type of person you are, you could be thinking one of two things. You could be thinking either how lucky I am or, like me, how I'd much rather the class not be all girls. They're all <em>really</em> out-going people too. I don't feel the most comfortable in that class, but it's not like it's necessarily in a bad way. I'm just uncomfortable. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(I'm not made to feel like I don't belong or are otherwise subjected to a negative experience; it's just awkward.)</span> One person does a really good job of making me feel uncomfortable. She's p38. For one thing, she likes making unnecessary physical contact like patting me on the head or poking me. She's told me that she does it to other people, &amp; I believe her, but it's still weird. Another creepy thing is how she said her goal in life is to have red haired children. In case you weren't paying attention, I have red hair. Something I could have gone my whole life without knowing is when she said that every once in a while she watches me eat. I can't tell if she does anymore. The most creepy thing she's done is when she said something along the lines of, "I just love you. I love all the things you say &amp; all the stuff you do." To be fair, she went on to say how there are many types of love, but that didn't help much. The thing that gives me mostly peace of mind is how she has <span class="person p39">a boyfriend</span> that even has red hair. If you want to make me feel comfortable, don't say or do anything she's said or done.
					</section>
					<section class="t11 t12">
						She's not the only weird one from that class, though. For awhile now, 2 people have been coming to my Academic Advisory during the time you can travel from class to class &amp; have just stood in the doorway saying my name &amp; waving for about 30 seconds &amp; then leave. I don't know about you, but I find it hard to believe that almost every Academic Advisory (most people call it Ac lab), usually the same 2 people have to talk to some teacher on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, &amp; they just happen to pass my classroom &amp; feel the sudden urge to be weird. It makes me wonder what they tell their teacher.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/25">
						Since it's not likely clear from my phrasing, I'd like to mention how I didn't actually have any negative opinions of all these people being weird. I may be using words like "weird" and "uncomfortable" and "creepy", but those were just my attempts to describe a general feeling of awkwardness. I was actually flattered by the interest they showed in me, and they were quite friendly; it's just that they were also quite strange, and being the reserved person that I was, their extra-friendly behavior brought out my awkwardness even more frequently than it was usually brought out. Although there can be debate over exactly how clear it was, I think my responses to their behavior adequately demonstrated that, although I felt awkward, I wasn't bothered by what they were doing.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other classes are fine. As usual, they're all extremely easy.
					</section>
					<section>
						Something sort-of related to school is what I call myself. For my entire life, I had gone by <span class="elaborate">Robbie</span>.<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25" data-heading="Extra information">Although half of my family thought I went by "Robby".</aside> When we moved, p1 said I needed to use a more grown-up name. He figured that we were at a place where no one knew me &amp; going from middle school to high school, so it would be a perfect time. I was already thinking the same thing but very well might not have done it if he didn't push me. He didn't have to push <em>that</em> hard, though. So now I'm Robert. It's an older name, &amp; I don't have to worry about whether to put my official name or not on something fairly official. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/25">I also just liked "Robert" better than "Rob", and I wanted a name that maintained some amount of distinction between p1 and me: P1 goes by p1.extra2, and it was enough of a headache having a p1.extra2 and a Robbie; there didn't need to be two Robs. P1, on the other hand, thought "Robert" sounded stuck-up, and he vehemently insisted that I use "Rob" instead. To this day 11 years later, he still introduces me as Rob.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						That pretty much catches you up to what's happening now. In case you didn't already figure it out, there is absolutely no way I wrote this whole entry in one day. It is now Christmas, &amp; I write this as I longingly stare at unopened presents. We have a family get-together every Christmas, so you can expect me to write about it tomorrow.

						Christmas was pretty good. The presents keep getting less interesting, but I realize we don't have much money, &amp; I was told I should figure out what I want. It's not like I don't want anything; I just can't think of everything at once. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">I would also never dwell much on what I wanted because I knew there was essentially no chance of us buying it, and allowing myself to imagine having it would just make me upset that I couldn't have it. However, with purging my mind of such thoughts, it also made it more difficult for me to think of what I wanted when given the opportunity.</span> We went to <span class="person p40">my aunt</span>'s house after a while. There were less people there than usual. We also did less than usual. I don't know what happened. We ate, &amp; later I got to open two extra presents. Everyone pretty much just talked the rest of the time, but we played a few, small games. There wasn't too much else that happened.

						I forgot two big things that happened in high school so far, so I guess I'll put it here. The first thing was all over the news. Some person in band was voted homecoming queen as a joke. It was said that people would humiliate her during the homecoming parade <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">(which I was in with the band)</span>, but everyone made sure that didn't happen. P1 was also interviewed about it for the news, &amp; we recorded it.
					</section>
					<section class="t11">
						Another thing was a bomb threat at the school. Apparently, someone spraypainted on one of the bathroom walls that they were going to blow up the school. We were all evacuated, but no bomb was found. We weren't allowed to go back to get our stuff, so I was locked outside the house for a few hours.

						Pacific doesn't strike me as a particularly inhospitable place, &amp; I don't think it used to be one either, but they could have gotten off on a better foot than that. What's even more sad is I think both of these things happened during the first quarter of school or close to it.

						It's been warm lately. This is the second time it's flurried this entire fall &amp; winter. Not even snow, just flurries. I don't think it snowed much last year either. The summer was really hot &amp; dry too. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/26">(I can't say for sure anymore, but I'm pretty much certain that the dryness only applied to the ground and rainfall, not the air which can still manage to be humid.)</span> They say food prices are going to go up a litte next year because of the smaller amount of crops that survived. We had a pretty consistant temperature of about 100 (Fahrenheit) for a long time. Now, it's hardly gotten below freezing every once in a while. It sure makes you want to believe in Global Warming. It's not like I haven't believed in Global Warming. I just haven't really seen any effects of it. I don't get why people are so against believing it. All they're doing is making it worse. The reason I believe is because I tend to believe calm, serious people rather than people frantically &amp; blindly searching for a reason to deny evidence. Also, I heard something like 98% of scientists believe Global Warming, but they're threatened so often that most of them are scared to say anything. Hopefully, at some point, people will wake up &amp; decide they have to do more than the puny amount they've done so far.

						The snow is finally starting to stick. I wonder how much it will pile up. The weather people said it's supposed to snow for a few days, but it didn't sound like much. I wish it would snow a lot. I like the snow &amp; have a whole bunch of stuff I would do in it. Before we ran out of snow, I started making igloos along with others. Sledding is always fun, but <span class="elaborate">I don't have a very good sled</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="2023/6/23">
							I later found out that it's not necessarily the (<span class="elaborate">one</span>) sled I had which was the problem; it was my size.<aside data-heading="Concession">There was at least one or two other sleds, but they weren't nearly as good, so I would never use them.</aside> I had a relatively small circular sled which worked fine for many years, but over time, it became harder and harder to sled. I attributed the problem to the accumulated scuff marks on the bottom along with a general mediocre construction in the first place and potentially insufficient snow. However, I rode on a substantially larger sled one day in non-ideal conditions, and I was able to sled quite well. It then occurred to me that the problem I had been having was likely due to the fact that I had grown and would now sink into the snow too much with my small sled for me to slide very easily.
						</aside>
						I always wanted to have a good snowball fight, but I couldn't get enough people together, &amp; the forts didn't provide much protection. We tried to make snowmen once or twice, but the problem is, grass would always get stuck in it, &amp; it wouldn't look that good. Another thing I would do when it was cold but not snowy was break up some of the ice of the pond &amp; skip/slide it across it. It makes a cool sound. This pond, though, is a little further away, &amp; I'm not sure if it's been cold enough for it to freeze over. I remember when the lake at the other house froze 5 inches thick. It will be a miracle if it even freezes an inch this year. All of you snow haters may be (have been, by the time you are reading this) having the time of your lives right now, but I'm still hoping we get some pretty good snow this year.

						It has occurred to me that I haven't told you what I'm going to become famous for. Assuming, with the great confidence I posess, that I become as famous as I plan to, you should already know this, but I'll tell you anyway. I am going to do things such as cure things, create new technology, make great discoveries, &amp; other, various important things. I'm not going to be satisfied just sitting around doing nothing or even sitting around doing only mediocre things. It's a waste to do anything but the best. I'll get this stuff done using my nearly completely unwavering determination. I know "nearly completely" doesn't sound as impressive, but that's about as sure as it gets with me. I have yet to see my confidence &amp; determination seriously rivaled by anyone. When I say something is happening, it's happening, whether you like it or not. It would take more than the apocalypse to stop it. Sure, there's varying degrees of my determination that have equally varying degrees of resistance that can stop it, but for some things, the entire universe could be against me, &amp; I'd still come out on top. One of those things is how I think I'm going to do great things. Not just <em>a</em> great thing, great thing<em>s</em>. If I didn't believe that with the utmost certainty, I wouldn't be writing this now. There's nothing you can do to stop me, so don't waste your time. I'm glad we got that cleared up.

						Yesterday I finished something awesome. I thought I should come up with a way to tell if there was mail in the mailbox, so I wouldn't have to check it, when coming off the school bus, only to find that nothing's there. I originally had a simpler design, but it used tape on the mailbox, and I wasn't allowed to put tape on the mailbox. That design might be better than the one I ended up using; I didn't get to test it. In the end, however, I got the other design to work. The basic idea is that the mail-person has to open the mailbox to put in the mail.

						Today has been the auditions for Conference Band. The band teachers say that the Conference Band plays at a school for an assembly once a year &amp; that they play once every 4 years at our school. Wouldn't it just so happen that this is the year they play at our school. I probably would have put off making a decision on whether to go or not until it was too late, but I figured that I would never have the opportunity to play at our school again, so I ought to try.

						I didn't make it. That stinks. They went to 8 places <span class="elaborate">(which is more than I thought they would)</span>,
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
							Throughout my time in band, there were only ever a few French Horn players in a band of about a hundred people, so it was rather surprising to me that, in a slightly smaller band, they would want over twice as many French Horn players.
						</aside>
						so the best I could have been was 9<sup>th</sup> out of, I think, 12 people. <span class="elaborate">So much for recent success stories.</span>
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Concession" data-date="2023/7/3">
							Even at the time, I thought this was a rather harsh statement to make (especially since the mailbox indicator was so cool), but I was quite let down that I'd never be able to perform for our school in Conference Band.
						</aside>
						I'll get over it, though. I think I hadn't practiced the stuff recently enough, &amp; I was nervous, so that didn't help. On a side note, I don't know what genius decided to put this thing that lasts until 9:00pm on a school night.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I think it turned out that I actually was 9<sup>th</sup> place which doesn't exactly help the situation because that would mean that I missed my only opportunity to play for the school by only one place after performing well below my true ability level. It still stings a little.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/7/3">
						A big issue with my audition (besides what I already stated) was that I don't think I ended up playing in the right key: The French Horn is notorious for producing similar-sounding notes while pressing down the same keys, and it does so irregularly, so if you don't recognize that the note you're playing isn't quite the right pitch but you try to match the effort and pitch difference required for going to the next note, you're going to miss every single note, and you won't be able to recognize the tune very well because some of the notes will be higher than they should be and others will be lower. A mistake like that can totally throw off your audition and then make it more likely you'll mess up afterwards because then you're extra nervous.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I decided that that description of a big issue with my audition was fairly confusing, so let me try again: With pretty much every instrument you blow air through, the sound that comes out depends not only on the keys you press down or holes you cover up but also on how you position and/or tighten your mouth. That's how a trumpet can play dozens of notes even though there are only 3 keys (8 combinations of pressed or unpressed). The Frech Horn is similar except for a fourth key and a hand in the bell which theoretically slightly changes the pitch (but no one in high school does anything with their hand). In most cases, however, the instrument kind-of locks you into a certain pitch, and the pitch won't change much until you make a relatively large change in your mouth, at which time the pitch jumps up or down a lot, and you can easily tell whether you're on the right note. With the French Horn you're still kind-of "locked in" to your note, but it takes much smaller changes in your mouth to jump to a different note, and the note you jump to is a lot closer in pitch to the note prior to the jump. Moreover, the pitch differences aren't the same for each combination of key presses, so rather than sounding like a song played in the wrong key if you get caught in the wrong pitch, it'll sound like a completely unrecognizable jumble of notes which don't follow the melody of the song (or scale) much at all, and you'll have a hard time determining whether you're trying to play slightly too high or slightly too low. (That's not to mention how some of the notes will actually be correct because the pitch difference to the next note is large enough that you get locked into the correct note, but you can't tell because the correct note doesn't sound right when all of the other notes are wrong.) I think I fell victim to this difficulty of the French Horn during my audition.

						People tell me far too many times that I have long eyelashes. It's weird. Once or twice in a long time is still weird, but more is just ridiculous. I don't know what possesses people (mostly girls) to tell me this. Once again, it's <em>weird</em>.
					</section>
					<div class="t14">
						<section class="t24">
							Speaking of weird girls, 2 people from my Explorations class (everyone calls it Odyssey, &amp; I'm not one to intentionally be an outsider, so that's what I'll call it) decided a few days ago, when they saw the person that normally sits across from me <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/12">at lunch</span> had moved &amp; was talking to someone else, that they would sit across from me. Today, since the person that moved away didn't go far, I told him jokingly, "You see what you've done? You moved away, &amp; now these people came over." I could tell they weren't offended, but they said, "Alright, we can take a hint." &amp; they moved to a different table. That was short-lived. I sort-of saw that coming before I said anything, but now I would have just kept quiet. It's nice to have people interested in me, &amp; that amount of people is slowly dwindling.
						</section>
						<section>
							At the beginning, most people were either just doing their own thing &amp; didn't pay attention to me or were really interested in me for some strange reason. If I had to guess, I'd say they were interested in me because I was new &amp; quiet which made most of me a mystery. I suppose less people care about the mystery now &amp; are beginning to do their own thing &amp; not pay attention to me. I can't remember how it went in 6<sup>th</sup> grade when I changed school districts, but I think I got more friends rather than a bunch of people losing interest in me. People still ask me for help on their work &amp; casually say something to me, but it's not the same.
						</section>
						<section class="t3">
							Sure, the obvious solution to this problem is to talk to more people, but I'm not that out-going. I often think that, if I either had a whole bunch of people to talk to or no one to talk to, I could be able to figure out how easily I could deal with both. You may think that I would obviously want to be around more people to not feel lonely, but I don't think it's that unlikely of a guess that, if I was ignored for long enough, I would get used to it, &amp; it wouldn't bother me that much.

						I've noticed (assuming I'm correct) that p38 is trying to keep me from being lonely. The only reason there's any doubt is because it's only noticeable for an extremely short period of time.

They are as follows: 1) makes me feel awkward 2) does something particularly strange compared to the norm &amp; 3) I have some reason for jokingly insulting them. Only one requirement has to be met to be considered weird. I'd say she fits that first one with great precision, but she makes me feel important, &amp; I like feeling important.

						What is this mysterious topic you ask? Well, hopefully you're familiar with the version of this that involves squares. You would be given a square that is made up of a bunch of smaller squares. Then you would be asked to find all the squares. Say you had a 3 by 3 square. First, you would notice that there are 9 of the small squares. Since all the squares don't have to be the same size, you would start looking for bigger ones. The next size up from 1 by 1 squares are the 2 by 2 ones. You would see ther are 4 of them. Finally, there is the one, big 3 by 3 square. That brings the total up to 14 squares in all. Tessellation conglomerates are based on that sort of idea. I have worked extensively on it &amp; have come up with all sorts of formulas to solve it. I have went on to different shapes &amp; exceptions &amp; slowly conquered each challenge. It would take me forever to explain it all to you.

I don't have instantaneous access of this journal, so I have time to think about how to perfect the wording. I make sure to not put in anything I'm going to regret later or cause others to think that certain things are being distorted due to my view on them. In the end, you might not have been able to tell that I was getting pretty lonely. Hopefully, this lull in the loneliness sticks around awhile.

I guess hours &amp; hours &amp; days &amp; days of work just spent on typing the article spread out over months has been wasted. It's <em>really</em> depressing. I suppose it's possible I may have said the same thing if I wasn't so personally attached to it, but that doesn't help much. I still want to make a website to publish original research. I'm not getting rid of my article, so when I make the website, I won't have to redo it.

						So, yesterday was Valentine's Day. I, of course, didn't have a valentine, but that doesn't matter to me too much. Besides, moving here over summer &amp; being shy doesn't exactly give me a head start. Apparently, there have been studies about Valentine's Day that say, to be the best valentine, you ought to wear red, carry a hot drink, &amp; speak into the person's right ear. Also, dark chocolate is best at first, but eventually, milk chocolate overtakes it. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/14">(Although, in my opinion, dark chocolate always wins.)</span> I don't understand some of that stuff, but oh well.

						There were these things called candygrams that people could buy at the school that would be given out during Academic Advisory. I was very surprised 2 days ago when I received one. Obviously, I was curious who would get me one, but I didn't have to wait long to find out. Since I don't have to change rooms, like most people do, to go to Academic Advisory, my teacher decided to give it to me before the previous class was over. <span class="p0">One of the people who sent it</span> saw me getting it &amp; said, "Oh, is that our valentine (might have said candygram)? We love you Robert!" Eventually, I read it, &amp; it said it was from p43, p44, &amp; p45 (people from my Odyssey class). At the bottom, underneath the typed print of "You're Awesome!!!!", was written, "Thanks for being such a good sport this year!" It had never seemed to me that anyone in that class (except slightly p38) payed very much attention to me at all. It still doesn't seem that way, but it gives me a new perspective. In the "To" part of the card was "Robert T. Benson". They got that from when, a long time ago, they saw a part on Wikipedia on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can_telephone">Tin can telephone</a> article that I added about making them go around corners. I had come up with the technique, so I put my name &amp; added the T so I wouldn't be confused with a Robert Benson already on Wikipedia. As you should already know, Wikipedia doesn't like original research, so it was almost completely deleted but not before they saw it. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">Extra information</span> Another ridiculous thing they say about my name is that it sounds like a fashion designer's name. Now, I wouldn't know what a fashion designer's name would sound like, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that my main profession is <em>not</em> going to be a fashion designer. That won't keep them from trying to convince me, though.

					<aside class="reflection t13" data-heading="Extra information" data-date="2023/11/14">
						Since Wikipedia has version control, you can still see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tin_can_telephone&diff=511668331&oldid=511570032">here</a> the section I added which was deleted. I say my section was "<em>almost</em> completely" deleted because, later on, a relatively small part was kept because I dug up a reference for a different (less effective) tactic. It seems that, during this beginning stage of my time on Wikipedia, I wasn't familiar enough with how changes were recorded to know how to see the history of changes and see the associated explanations. One of my big issues with my section being deleted was that "no explanation" was given, and I firmly expressed my discontent on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tin_can_telephone#Changes_made_to_this_article">the article's talk page</a> (a somewhat hidden part of every article meant for discussing the content). The people in Odyssey also read that, and <span class="person p44">one of them</span> said how they would go to me the next time they needed to write a strongly-worded letter. It turns out that there actually was a very brief edit description referencing unsourced original research, and I'm a little embarrassed now for so boldly referencing myself, but I was trying my best, and I had a somewhat different perspective of Wikipedia at the time. Also, it's quite a frustrating experience to know something you want to share, but you don't have any way of proving what you know (besides challenging people to try it themselves). This isn't as much of a problem for me anymore now that I can make websites easily, but you better have some solid references if you're going to put anything on Wikipedia. This isn't the end of my time on the Tin can telephone Wikipedia article, though.

						I'd say 13 hours is a new record for time slept by me. You can't sleep much longer without being in a coma. I think I've trained my body to sleep a long time on Saturday to make up for the sleep I don't get during the week. I had 3 dreams last night about catching mice.

					<section class="t13">
						Yesterday, I put the finishing touches on my mouse trap. My parents have said how they're going to get something to catch the mice, but that won't happen for a very long time assuming it even does. I decided to take matters into my own hands &amp; used a bunch of popsickle sticks &amp; tape to create a mouse trap. It's a sort of box that has an opening on one end. I attached a "door" to the opening at the top &amp; had the bottom slanted inwards. This way, the mice could push in through the door, but when they tried to push out, the door would be stopped by the bottom, &amp; they couldn't get out. Yesterday, I put it all in a pretzel bag to disguise it &amp; baited it with a pretzel. I think the door was too hard to push in because the pretzel is still in there &amp; no mouse. I made the door a little easier for them to push in, so maybe I'll get a mouse tonight. Hopefully, the popsickle sticks are tough enough to not be nibbled through.

Maybe I'm too used to people not giving me a second thought, so when they do, it means more to me than it would normally. This is probably why I think about p38 so much.

Moreover, I'm pretty sure I knew for a fact that at least one of the people who sent me the candygram definitely did have the same math teacher.

						Today has been our first snow day. If you'll notice the date, I'd consider this far too late to have our <em>first</em> snow day. P1 had me shovel a ridiculous amount. You would think that the amount of sleet that came along with the snow would make it good snow to make snowballs with, but it didn't. Among these random thoughts is the one that I should have done something fun in it. Maybe I didn't because I don't have anyone to do anything with. Maybe it's because I'd have to put on too many layers, &amp; I don't want to go through all that trouble. Maybe it's just because there isn't really that much to do anyway; I can't have a snowball fight (no people to have it with), I can't sled (my sled gets stuck in the snow because, as I recently thought of, I weigh more than when I was a little kid), I can't make an igloo (I wouldn't trust the mediocre snow), making a snow angel wouldn't keep me interested that long, &amp; I'm not sure how well a snowman would hold up. Most likely, I didn't do anything because of all those reasons combined. I don't think any one of those reasons would have deterred me.

						On a different note, my social studies teacher, p47, has her birthday today. She was saying how she would not be happy if we didn't have a snow day today. During class, she showed us a website that I think was called snow day calculator. You typed in a few things &amp; it would tell you how likely it is to have a snow day. Today was 99%. Tomorrow was 84%. We're having a snow day tomorrow, so I'd say that website is pretty good. Four-day weekend!

						Yesterday, a fairly important thing happened to me. A while ago, my Odyssey class wrote essays about "what giftedness means to a gifted student". I won 3<sup>rd</sup> place for highschool in the state. Whoever got 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> got to go to <span class="elaborate">Jefferson City</span> to be recognized. <aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Extra information" data-date="2023/11/15">The capital of Missouri</aside> The strange thing is, both 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> were also in my class: p48 &amp; p49. I was wondering how many people actually entered the contest, but the person coordinating the event said 250 people entered. If everyone was evenly distributed between elementary, middle, &amp; high school, there would be about 83 or 84 people competing. You can figure out the probability of the 3 highschool winners being in the same class if you're feeling ambitious. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">I'm feeling ambitious.</span>
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection t13" data-heading="Nerding out" data-date="2023/11/15">
						To make the numbers a little easier to work with (and provide a more generous probability in the end), let's assume the participants were skewed a little towards the elementary and middle school categories and that there were only 80 entries in the high school category. There are over 550 school districts in Missouri, but they obviously didn't all enter. Let's assume that the average class size in the schools that entered was my class size (8) which would mean that 10 schools entered (&lt;2% of all schools in Missouri). (Actually, that assumption wouldn't matter, but it's interesting to gague what the participant pool might've been like.) The probability of any particular school having a winner (if there was only one) would be 8 in 80 (10%). However, since having a winner reduces the number of people left who can win, the probability of having a second winner would be 7 in 79, and a third would be 6 in 78. To get the probability of getting all 3 winners, you would need to multiply all of the probabilities (8/80 &times; 7/79 &times; 6/78) which would give <strong>a chance of about 0.068%</strong>. You could expect all 3 winners to come from the same high school <strong>only once every 1,471 times</strong> you held the essay contest (which would also be the number of years you'd have to wait for that outcome in a yearly essay contest). Note how the way I determined the probability of all 3 winners being from my class doesn't actually depend on how many schools entered or what their class sizes were, so this should be a fairly reliable probability; however, given such extremely slim odds, I can't help but second-guess my calculations and wonder how something like this could've been possible. Even if there were only 50 participants in high school, there would still only be a 0.29% chance. You would have to bring the participants down to 33 just to have a 1% chance. Also, although I don't think I would make that kind of mistake, if you went by strictly what was written here, you could interpret "250 people entered" to mean "250 people were in the high school category" which would bring the likelihood down to 0.0022%. Am I missing something here?

						I couldn't find the original essay contest, but it seems to have been conducted by the <a href="http://www.mogam.org/">Gifted Association of Missouri</a> with a Capitol Building celebration agenda similar to the one <a href="http://www.mogam.org/gam-at-the-capitol.html">here</a>.

It turns out, the p48.lastName()s are p48's family. Something funny I noticed about the back of their van is that it said "Odyssey". I guess it was the Odyssey model of the van. After a bunch of confusion about where to park &amp; where to go, we finally made it.
					</section>
					<section>
						There were a lot more people than you would expect, most of which (other than adults) were noticeably younger. Do people really become that much older-looking between middle school &amp; high school? There was also a video contest, so there was even more people.

						Before anyone did much of anything, some people led us to watch Congress. The first thing they (&amp; we) did was pray &amp; say the Pledge of Allegiance. My immediate first thought was, "They aren't doing a very good job of separation of church &amp; state." They pray at the inauguration of the president too. It makes me wonder what goes through these people's heads when they decide to do this.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, after that, they started this extremely long, drawn-out, ridiculous process of introducing people including us. Also, even though they told us to turn off our phones &amp; don't bring any food or drinks, I saw the Congress people using their phones, &amp; they had all sorts of drinks. All of those people didn't even seem to be paying attention to whoever was talking. If that many people had side conversations in a classroom, the teacher's head would explode. I think I figured out why nothing gets done in Congress &amp; why everyone complains about them.
					</section>
					<section>
						Once everyone got tired of listening to them, they took us back to the first floor. When we were there, they talked some &amp; started handing out awards. The awards were just pieces of paper. The first place people got an envelope as well that I think might have had a check. I don't think my essay was deserving of 3<sup>rd</sup> place. I ramble on about my life &amp; don't make much of a point. If I knew the essay was also supposed to promote gifted education (a part which the instructions left out), I think I could have made it better. To be fair to myself, the more I look at anything I did, the worse I think I did at it with <em>very</em> few exceptions. I still think I could have done better, though. p48 (who won first) said how she finds it hard to believe that her essay was best in the state, but I don't think it's that hard to believe.

There were individual pictures, &amp; then they tried to get me in a group picture with p48 &amp; p49 (1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup>). They weren't even satisfied with me standing on the side; they made me go in between them. I didn't get second, so why do I have to stand in the middle? There were a few, more serious, pictures taken, &amp; then they wanted to take a goofy one. I'm not one for goofy photos, so I didn't really do anything, but both of them did. At first, they didn't know what to do, but then they decided to lean up against me, turn to the side, make a gun with both of their hands, &amp; point it in the air like people do in action movies. It was weird.

						Afterwards, we were encouraged to talk to our representatives &amp; senators to stress the importance of the gifted program.
					</section>
					<section>
						Before I go on, here is my view on the gifted program. I think that their heart is in the right place, but they're going about it the wrong way. For one thing, Odyssey is, by far, the least productive class out of any other. It's probably the nicest but definitely the least productive. People say how they like the challenge, but Odyssey isn't challenging. We skim over a variety of topics but never get in-depth enough to make it challenging. I think there ought to be advanced classes, so there will be a challenging class for whichever subject someone's good at. Also, I think they ought to do classes like they do in highschool earlier. People should be able to take classes based on their ability level. Anyway, that's my point of view.
					</section>
					<section>
						Back to the Capitol Building, there was some guide that led us to our representative &amp; senator. It turns out that our representative was Speaker of the House. There was a photographer apparently following him to take pictures. He seemed nice &amp; gave us pens. It was black &amp; said, "p50.firstName.string.toUpperCase p50.middleName.string.0. p50.lastName.string.toUpperCase SPEAKER" in golden print. Later, we found our senator, &amp; when he was told 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> were from his district, he said, "Of course, what did you expect?" He seemed nice as well.
					</section>
					<section>
						There wasn't much else to do after that, so we eventually left. Before we went very far, we found a place to eat. I'm not used to being given that much food. I still ate it all, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						During the drive back, we stopped at my grandparents' (on p2's side) house because they were on the way. We talked, &amp; they wanted to see my essay, but I didn't have it. I'm getting more &amp; more reluctant to let people read my essay because I keep thinking it's worse &amp; worse. I really don't think it's very good. At the very least, it's not very good compared to my standards for myself. After awhile, we left my grandparents' house &amp; went home. Pretty fascinating story, huh.

						p51 is the second person to ever figure out when my birthday is based on how many seconds I said there are until then. In case you can't remember from the beginning of this book <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/18">(actually website)</span>, my birthday is March 11 (notice how close it's getting).
					</section>
					<section>
						What? You want to know what's going on with the seconds? Well, somewhere around 6<sup>th</sup> grade or a little earlier, I decided it would be cool to figure out how many seconds there are until things. I always keep track of how many seconds are until next year &amp;, when they're about a month away, Christmas &amp; my birthday. At some point, I may step it up but not right now. Since everyone knows when Christmas &amp; next year is, the only mystery is when my birthday is. Once I start keeping track of how many seconds there are until my birthday, you aren't going to get the actual day out of me. Usually, people are too lazy to pick up a calculator to put their curiosity to rest.
					</section>
					<section>
						Three years ago, p19 surprised me by figuring out when my birthday was based on the seconds. I didn't even realize he was figuring it out until he told me when it was.
					</section>
					<section class="t15">
						For the record, I figure out the seconds on a daily basis. Right after I tell people how many seconds there are until something, they usually wait a second &amp; ask "How many is it now?" I realize they're just trying to be funny, but <em>everyone</em> tries to be funny in the same way. Besides, in that many seconds, it will still be my birth<em>day</em>. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/18">I also get complaints about how I'm calculating to midnight instead of the time of my birth, but besides the fact that it's easier to work with whole numbers of days, people would then change their mind and start complaining that I wasn't calculating to the beginning of the day, anyway. If I was born at 11:59pm, would my birthday only last one minute? I think not, so I'm calculating to midnight, and you all can just get over it.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						Today, I was telling people that there's 604,800 seconds until my birthday, &amp; p51 decided she'd figure out when it was. She did it the hard way by going through minutes &amp; hours (like p19 did). The easier way is to know how many seconds are in a day (86,400). When I finally put in the effort to memorize it, there was so much less trouble. If you knew me &amp; thought it would have been cool to have your name published someplace but it's not in here, maybe you shouldn't have been so lazy &amp; figured out when my birthday is, so you could have been put in here. It's <em>really</em> pathetic that only 2 people in 4 years have figured out when my birthday is based on the seconds. I think my math teacher will figure it out when I see her tomorrow, but still, I shouldn't be able to keep track of each person who does it; it's not that hard to do. People are lazy.

						I think I overreact when people are nice to me. You wouldn't be able to tell, but when people compliment me or act interested in me, I end up really liking that person for that period of time. For a while now, I've been fooled into thinking that I'm liking the whole person in general rather than just the way they're treating me at the time. Of course, the way a person treats me at the time is a large part of who they are in general, but I've noticed that I don't like them nearly as strongly when they seem to not notice me much at all. If I liked the person in general, it wouldn't really matter if they were paying attention to me or not. I know it's hard to be convinced of the validity of this argument, but I guess the main point I'm trying to get across is that I have control of my emotions again.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't like the feeling that there is something about myself that I can't control. That includes my emotions. I don't like having a hard time deciding the right thing to do because my emotions are clouding my judgement. Sure, happy emotions are good, but I don't want to blindly do other things for them &amp; not be able to think it through. It's just the concept of me doing anything that I can't think through or control that I don't like. Keeping full control over my emotions &amp; actions, though, probably keeps me from letting loose a bunch of the time. P1 has compared me to a vulcan from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek"><i>Star Trek</i></a> &amp; a robot. I think those comparisons are pretty extreme, especially in the way he impersonates them, but I will admit that I am less emotional than most people. I have enough emotion to sympathize &amp; still feel things, but the rest is very mild.
					</section>
					<section>
						So anyway, I have rationalized yet another feeling &amp; now can control it. Even though I doubt this will be the last time this sort of thing happens, I am much more at ease knowing I can explain my emotions &amp; actions. Hopefully you haven't been too bored with me summarizing stuff I've said before in a rambling sort of way (which is about how I feel I made my essay that I got 3<sup>rd</sup> place on).

						IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!!! WHOO HOO!!!! There are now only 31,536,000 seconds until my birthday. Or 0 seconds, whichever you prefer.
					</section>
					<section class="t17">
						Each year, there are 3 times that I'm determined to stay happy during. One of those is Christmas. Another is for as long as possible during summer break. The last is, you guessed it, my birthday. I'd say I'm doing a fantastic job at it. I have so much more energy &amp; feel great. Being happy is awesome! Who would have thought? I'm not necessarily sad most of the time, but I'm not necessarily happy most of the time either, just sort-of indifferent. I almost feel like a different person with so much happiness. I've <em>really</em> pumped myself up for my birthday. I'm surprised there's that much in me.
					</section>
					<section>
						At the beginning of 1<sup>st</sup> hour, I received a happy birthday paper &amp; a Tootsie Pop from the principal like everyone does on their birthday. Two out of four classes sung happy birthday for me. Something I think is strange is how p52, whose birthday is the same as mine, didn't get as much attention for his birthday. He's had more time to get to know more people &amp; is more out-going, so why would he not get, at least, equally noticed? It happens with other people as well. Every once in awhile, I hear someone say, "Oh, it's your birthday today? Well, happy birthday!" And that's all there is to it.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't understand why, in the relatively small amount of time people notice me, people act like they've known me all their lives &amp; that we're best friends but don't do that for most other people. I've speculated before but come to no definate conclusion. Random people in the halls that I don't even know have done the same thing. I don't get it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Continuing on with my day, one person asked if I was getting my permit <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/21">since I was now 15</span>. No. I doubt if I will for a long time. A different thing that happened is p38, I think specifically because it was my birthday, decided it would be funny to try to tickle the back of my neck when everyone was leaving the lunch room. It was weird. Not much else happened at school.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I got home, I didn't expect anyone to get home for a very long time because there had been problems with a car &amp; my parents decided my birthday would be the perfect time to fix it. To my surprise, p2 showed up a lot earlier with some balloons. Once p1 finally got home, we ate chocolate cake &amp; Ice Cream Oreo Cake after I blew out the candles. There were 15 candles arranged in the shape of 15 (guess how old I am). I got one present with a few things in it. The main things were a black light in the shape of those curly fluorescent lightbulbs &amp; a mini FM radio. They're pretty cool. Birthdays are awesome!

						Yesterday, I made the most amazing igloo ever single-handedly. I mostly used snow from off the cars that p2 gave to me. It took me the whole day to make it, but in the end, I had a fairly roomy igloo that you could lay down in. My parents compared it to a cocoon &amp; a mud dauber nest. Usually, I don't agree with my parents' comparisons, but I have to admit that it looks a whole lot like that. While I was building my amazing igloo, p1 made an enormous snowman; it must be around 6 feet tall. He made a surprisingly good face to go along with it.

					<section>
						Now would probably be a good time to mention it's spring. There has been more winter-like weather now than there was in winter, but the groundhog said it was going to be an early spring.
					</section>
					<section class="t15">
						That brings up another point. Groundhog's Day is the most ridiculous day there ever was. What genius put a <em>groundhog</em> in charge of saying what <em>season</em> it is! It makes no sense! Isn't it strange how everyone can tell when summer, fall, &amp; winter starts, but they need to ask a groundhog when spring starts. There's probably some sentimental reason behind it, but it's time to move on. It's just ridiculous.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection t15" data-date="2023/11/24">
						I found out within the next few years that the start of spring doesn't actually change depending on whether the groundhog sees its shadow. Groundhog Day is supposed to determine whether there are 6 more weeks of winter or whether there's an "early" spring, and ever since I started forming my own thoughts, I've thought it was one of the most ridiculous things in the world. To be clear, I always knew there was a spring equinox which <em>should</em> dictate the beginning of spring like the fall equinox does for fall, but I was under the impression that whoever does the relevant paperwork or whatever declares spring to start at a different time depending on whether the groundhog saw its shadow. I've complained about it to my friends, my parents, and even my teachers, and not once did anyone ever tell me that spring (officially) starts at the same time every year no matter what happens (presumably because they also didn't know or maybe they misunderstood me). Later on, I started wondering when, exactly, spring starts if it comes early since I started getting the impression that it wasn't immediately after Groundhog Day, and no one could tell me until, one day, I finally stumbled across <span class="person p53">someone</span> who had risen above the ignorance of society, and they told me how an "early" spring means there's "only" 6 more weeks of winter left whereas a "long" winter means there's a "whole" 6 more weeks of winter left. By the way, it was a friend of mine who told me this, not an adult. This obviously makes much more sense than that a large rodent is dictating our seasons, but society does plenty of other dumb stuff without explanation, so I don't consider something being dumb to be sufficient reason to think it's not true (regarding society, that is). I didn't have as much access to the internet at this time, so maybe I would've been able to clear this up sooner if I did, but even online, it's not obvious what's going on with Groundhog Day. I thought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Wikipedia article on Groundhog Day</a> mentioned how the start of spring doesn't actually change, but according to the current version, it's unclear at best. I could edit the Wikipedia article to be more clear, but I'm not sure how much more time I want to spend on this. I suppose you could make the argument that Groundhog Day is meant to predict the <em>start of spring-like weather</em> as opposed to the actual date spring commences, but I think that's an important distinction no one ever makes, and besides that, there are studies showing Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are extremely inaccurate. So there you go: If you, like me, didn't know that Groundhog Day had absolutely nothing to do with when spring begins, now you do, and you can shift your perspective from Groundhog Day being a dumb occasion to being a goofy and potentially misleading occasion.

						Today, I got my first phone. You're probably thinking, "You're just now getting your first phone!" I realize there are some 6-year-olds with phones, but I just never felt the dire need to have a phone. There just wasn't ever a time where I had to have a phone to talk to the masses of people lining up to learn more about my life. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/24">Also, look at the date of this entry; cell phones weren't new, but you could only do so much with them without spending a whole lot of money (and even then, only so much), and my family had always been behind the times because we didn't have much money. What use do I have for something that I would only ever use to talk to my parents, take grainy photographs, and play a small selection of really pathetic games?</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						What brought up getting a phone was the trip the band is going on Wednesday. We're going to leave after school on Wednesday to Virginia &amp; come back on Sunday. Things would be a lot easier if I had my own phone for the trip. P1 said that he would get me a phone if I really wanted one but not if I just didn't want to use p2's phone on the trip. (They figured I needed a phone for the trip &amp; that I could use p2's which is ridiculous.) Eventually, I convinced myself that I'm tired of dealing with problems that could be solved with a phone, &amp; p1 began attempting to get a phone. At first, it seemed as if we had to get one mailed to us (to get <span class="elaborate">triple minutes</span>) &amp; that it would arrive too late, but then, out of the blue, p1 finds a triple minute phone at Walmart (which, apparently, aren't at Walmart very often), &amp; he buys it. There's still a few things that need to be worked out, but everything seems to be going fairly well.
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/11/29">
						Although it would've been possible to choose a reasonably sophisticated phone with some variety of unlimited plan like most people had, cost was a major consideration, so p1 was only really looking into cheap phones and plans like p2's (whereas p1's stuff was more expensive). P2 had a prepaid plan which required you to buy the minutes, texts, data, and service days ahead of time, and you would lose use of the phone when you ran out. With the service provider we were using (<a href="https://www.tracfone.com/home">TracFone</a>), it was possible to buy certain phones which would double or triple the number of minutes and stuff you got when you bought them. For example, if you bought the cheapest service bundle (for about $<span data-currency="USD">20</span>), you would ordinarily get 60 minutes, 60 texts, 60 megabytes of data, and 90 service days; however, if you had a triple-minutes phone, all of that (except for the service days) would be tripled (180 minutes, 180 texts, and 180 megabytes). It's obviously rather desirable to get three times the value for your money, so it's not very surprising that my parents wanted to take advantage of that, but you have to try harder to make sure you get that perk.

						Yesterday, we returned from our band trip to Virginia. There's a whole lot I want to say about it, &amp; you can be sure that I won't write this whole thing in just the date above.
					</section>
					<section>
						For our journey, we loaded up &amp; got in two, gigantic, red busses. The seats were like felt, one-person couches. There were also mini TVs scattered throughout the bus to watch movies. The windows were huge too with screens that came down to block some of the sun.
					</section>
					<section>
						I ended up in the second bus. We rode in the busses FOREVER. We went past the arch, through Illinois, through Indiana, &amp; through Kentucky. There was a few times where we stopped at rest stops. Kentucky was were we ran into problems.

						</div>
						At about 3 in the morning, smoke started pouring out of the first bus. We had to pull off to a gas station. Once everyone decided there was no hope in sleeping, we got off the bus (also there's some weird rule about how passengers have to get off the bus while it's fueling up). It was funny watching 100-something kids overrun a gas station with one employee there. Eventually, they said they fixed it &amp; we could get back on. Isn't it strange then how we broke down again a few hours later in West Virginia. I'm not happy with just a few hours of sleep. Apparently, a hose on the bus broke &amp; they decided to try to fix it by stretching what was left of the hose to the other side. Eventually, the hose completely broke, &amp; we were left with this predicament. The 5 hours we were there while waiting to get the part replaced was mostly uneventful. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/25">I juggled some random stuff when I didn't think anyone was looking because I was bored.</span>

						There was one thing that stuck with me however. It's sad to see how the boys' line to the bathroom disappears almost instantly while the girls' line is enormous for a very long time. A few girls, though, decided it would be a great idea to go into the empty boy's bathroom, so they wouldn't have to wait. Just so you know my point of view on this, it is <span style="font-weight:bold"><em style="text-decoration:underline">NOT OKAY</em> TO USE THE OTHER GENDER'S BATHROOM UNLESS SOMEONE IS <em>DYING</em> AND THERE'S <em>NO ONE ELSE</em> AROUND!</span> It's amazing I didn't have nightmares for weeks afterwards. Needless to say, I was scared to go to the bathroom there after that.

						</div>
						Once our 5 hours was up, we finally got back on the road. The Appalachian Mountains are cool. I can only imagine what the Rocky Mountains or something even bigger would be like. The mountains were gigantic with tons of trees. The ocean was also cool. It went on forever. At last, we had finally reached Virginia!

						It was still daylight, &amp; we unpacked our stuff &amp; entered the hotel (Best Western). I was in a room with 3 other people. The best part about the room was that there was a small deck overlooking the ocean. It was an amazing view.
					</section>
					<section>
						There wasn't much to do once everyone was in their rooms, so the other people in my room started a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)">Mau</a> (assuming that's how you spell it) &amp; invited me to play. It's a card game with strange rules loosely based off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">Uno</a>. Every time you break a rule you get another card, &amp; one of the rules is to not talk about the rules. When someone wins a round, they get to make up a new rule for the next round. The rules always begin the same, so it takes a while to get interesting. My version of this game would be that everyone starts off making a rule that has no exceptions. When someone wins, they get to make up their own rule. The only other fundemental rules would be: everyone starts with the same amount of cards, you can only lay down one card at a time, fines can be only one card per rule, &amp; you want to get rid of all your cards. You could also make it so you <em>don't</em> want to lose your cards which would be an interesting way to mix it up.

						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Reined horses.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						Anyway, back to the trip, we went to Colonial Williamsburg the next day. It was authentic but not very interesting. We walked forever while dodging poop that horses pulling carriages had left for us.
					</section>
					<section>
						After hours of that, we eventually made our way to <a href="https://wjccschools.org/lhs/">Lafayette High School</a> to play for <a href="https://www.musicintheparks.com/">Music in the Parks</a> (the actual reason we went to Virginia). There are a few judges, &amp; we play in a mostly empty auditorium. We also had to play music we had never seen before in a different room, but there wasn't much else.
					</section>
					<section>
						We headed back for the hotel, &amp; after we got there, that's when my day took a turn for the worst. That night I threw up in 3 different <span class="elaborate">sets</span>.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/11/29">I say "sets" because I threw up multiple times in a row.</aside>
						It was <em>really</em> disgusting. I could go into great detail, but no one wants to hear that. The only thing I'll say is that throwing up is <strong>NOT</strong> the way I wanted to be reminded that my sinuses are connected to my mouth. I hadn't thrown up in years &amp; years, so I was wondering what could have caused it. Someone in my hotel room said they thought it was from me eating the salad at Cici's Pizza. I couldn't be sure, but now I'm going to be scared of their salad. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/29">My parents suggested that I threw up because I was nervous about being away from home, but I can say with absolute certainty that that was <em>not</em> the explanation. I'm not so sure I was able to convince them of that, though.</span>

						The next day, I was feeling better but wasn't going to push it. The awards ceremony for Music in the Parks was being held at <a href="https://buschgardens.com/williamsburg/">Busch Gardens</a>, an amusement park in the setting of villages with various scenery. I have never really been a fan of rollercoasters because I don't like feeling like I'm going to die. Before I rode one, I thought they were really cool. I don't like being scared of something enjoyed by so many people, so I was planning on riding a few of the less extreme rollercoasters to try to get over it. Being sick the night before ruined all of that. I could feel myself getting worse as I walked around instead of resting. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2023/11/29">Side story</span> When we finally made our way to the awards ceremony, we found out we got second, but it looked like there was no more than 10 schools there. I just knew that I couldn't walk around after the ceremony without throwing up again, so <span class="p0">our chaperone</span> found a place for me to sleep <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/29">(outside)</span>. When it got cold, she took me to someplace inside. I'm glad I slept because I felt a whole lot better but not healed. Eventually everyone went back to the hotel.
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection t11" data-heading="Side story" data-date="2023/11/29">
						Unrelated to how sick I was, there was something I found particularly interesting as I shuffled around with my group. <span class="person p54">One of the people</span> in my group (who was also a French Horn player) had <span class="person p55">a younger sister</span> who was also in the band. At one point, we met up with her and one of her friends (I think it was only one), and we walked around with them for a while until they decided they wanted to go elsewhere. Later on, we met up with them again except, this time, they weren't alone: They each were holding onto a guy. These guys definitely weren't in the band, and they looked a fair bit older than them (although I'm terrible at gauging age). I felt like I missed something because I couldn't believe it, but I'm pretty sure they had just met the guys in the time they had been separated from us. They were holding hands and kissing, and I was having a hard time understanding how something like this could happen. The one girl's brother didn't seem to have a high opinion of his sister's moral character. It was pretty crazy.
					</aside>
					<section>
						The next morning, we loaded up the busses &amp; left for home. I slept most of the way there (I didn't before). As we approached the high school (where we left from), I noticed that previously dormant trees were budding.
					</section>
					<section>
						After my constantly late parents arrived, they picked me up, &amp; my journey was over. Of course they didn't take me home first; we went to some store. On the bright side, there were some Easter eggs with candy in them left over from an Easter egg hunt they held a week ago that I found &amp; got to keep. In addition, it turns out that my parents got high-speed internet &amp; Wi-Fi while I was gone. Also, I got a "WELCOME BACK" balloon. What an experience!

						Summer break has finally come!!!!!! Friday was our last day, &amp; it was an early release day! Well, 2<sup>nd</sup>-to-last day depending on what you count.
					</section>
					<section>
						Today was graduation for the seniors, &amp; the band had to play for them. Like most days, today was ridiculously hot. We only played one song (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomp_and_Circumstance_Marches">Pomp &amp; Circumstance</a>) &amp; had to sit through the rest in the scorching sun. There wasn't much special about the ceremony, so I'll spare you the details.
					</section>
					<section>
						On a side note, I got sunburned from sitting there that long. My knees even got sunburned! It doesn't hurt right now &amp; I hope it stays that way. If you look close enough, you can see that my freckles aren't sunburned. It's weird-looking.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, as I was walking out of the high school after putting my stuff back, <span class="person p56">the principal</span> stopped me &amp; told me about a summer, Internet German course.
					</section>
					<section>
						Before I continue, I need to tell you what's going on with German. This school is so small that there aren't enough people interested to sustain a German class. What a tragedy! Even though there isn't a German class, I still want to learn German. Also, I'm sure there's other people who would want to learn German as well. I bet there would be enough people interested to have a German <em>club</em>. And so the idea of German club came about. Who would teach German club if there's no one at the school left who knows it well enough you ask? Me. I am one of the few people who have the ability to learn a language &amp; understand it quickly enough to be able to teach it after only a summer of learning. Besides, I would only be teaching basic German the first year, so I'm not having doubts that I'll be able to pull it off. <span class="t18">I'm awesome at languages</span> as anyone in my Spanish class could tell you. I've been coming up with plans for what to do, but a big problem is that I don't know how many people will join. I guess I'll just have to figure it out when next year starts.
					</section>
					<section>
						Something I didn't like about a German club, though, is that no one got a German credit for it. I asked <span class="person p56">the principal</span> about it, &amp; he gave vague suggestions, but I wasn't too sure if I would be able to get people credit for it. However, when he talked about the online, summer German course, he said there would be credit for it! I am <em>so</em> lucky that I was in band &amp; had to play for graduation. Graduation is just after summer break starts, &amp; if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have known about the course until next school year. I'm wondering if people will be less inclined to be in a German club if they can take it over summer, but I think there will be at least some people who won't take the effort to go online without having the advantage of already knowing German or want to have a classroom experience which can tend to some needs that a computer can't.
					</section>
					<section class="t3 t19">
						There are probably many people that doubt my teaching ability because of how shy I am. Something most people don't realize is that I'm capable of acting like I have no problem talking to people I don't know very well if I have good enough reason. Good reason would include selling things, explaining things, &amp; leading people, among other things. Teaching would fall under the category of explaining things. I'm going to make this German club work, &amp; <span class="t1">as I've said before, when I say something's happening, it's happening</span>.

						In case you haven't noticed, I've probably talked about p38 more than anyone else in here other than me. That's because I like her more than I want to admit.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing I want to make perfectly clear before I go on is I would <em>never NEVER</em> tell <em>anyone</em> any of this directly. As for why I'm writing it in here, I don't have the best reasoning. Deep, deep, <em>deep</em> down, I want to talk about this sort of stuff, but I could make it without venting. I guess it doesn't seem so awkward when I'm writing with no one knowing my thoughts, but I know good &amp; well that this is going to get published. The point is, this isn't one of my more thought-out entries.
					</section>
					<section>
						I've been trying to delay writing about this until summer which I've obviously accomplished. I almost gave in &amp; wrote about it earlier, but then I remembered about the awesome igloo I made &amp; decided to write about that instead. My reasoning for waiting until summer to write about this is just about as good as my reasoning to write about this at all; I'm not exactly sure why. Although I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this, I'm going to continue. Consider yourself lucky because, once again, I would <em>NEVER</em> tell you this in person or otherwise.
					</section>
					<section>
						From the beginning, I liked how she was nice to me, but I wasn't going to be swayed that easily. However, over time of consistently being nice to me, it started to wear me down. I think if I had more close friends, someone being nice to me wouldn't be such a big deal. I doubt p38 was treating me special very much except for trying to make me feel included because she knew I was alone often. Ordinarily, I may try to timidly convince myself that I should maybe think about going along with my emotions, but she has a <span class="person p39">boyfriend</span> (the same one I mentioned before), &amp; I'm not going to get in the way of any sort of a relationship unless it's borderline abusive. Besides, I think he's better suited for her than I would be; he's much more out-going &amp; openly affectionate. Also, he seems pretty nice although I don't know him well. I have spent the majority of second semester trying to get her out of my head. I feel bad to even think about anything with her in it because she has a boyfriend. Probably something like 90% of all internal struggles about liking people I've written in here are related to her in some way.
					</section>
					<section class="t16">
						If only it was easier to think of her as just a friend; I bet she would be a pretty good one. Towards the end of school, though, she had started to pay less attention to me, so it <em>did</em> become easier for me. I have guesses as to why she started paying less attention to me, but the evidence to support them is nearly non-existent. When I think about how p38 treated me, I know it was only how a nice friend would treat me which makes me wonder if I'm going to be able to have nice friends (that are girls anyway). I've thought for a while that, if I got a girlfriend (which would be a serious commitment for me), I would be able to focus all of these sorts of emotions on her &amp; so eliminate all problems of liking anyone too much, but I have yet to test this theory, &amp; I don't see that changing in the near future.

						I don't want to have to eliminate half of all my potential good friends. In addition, girls seem to actually want to talk to me somewhat as opposed to just I'm there so they might as well talk to me. I'm not saying all boys fit into that 2<sup>nd</sup> category (&amp; I would like to think that I don't most of the time), but I think it's safe to assume that more boys do than girls. I know it's not meant in a mean way, but that's the sort of feeling I get. I wonder, though, if it would be the opposite if I were a girl.
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Contrary to popular belief, I like talking to people &amp; am lonely all the time. I think that people are under the impression that I like to be alone with my thoughts because I'm such a quiet person. Let me clear this up once &amp; for all: that is not true what so ever. There are very very few times that I would ever not want to talk to anyone about anything unless I hated their guts which is also very very unlikely. I am NOT one of those people always searching for peace &amp; quiet. You may think that I might take this back if I started to talk to a bunch of people, but I wouldn't be too confident about that. I'm very good at imagining scenarios &amp; coming to an objective conclusion. Sure there would be times that I got tired of being unproductive of got just plain tired, so I would force myself to end the conversation, but I would still <em>want</em> to talk. If you ever think that I'm getting tired of listening to you talk, you're WRONG! The only times it may be true are if you're trying to get me angry or bore me to death, both of which are pretty hard to do.
					</section>
					<section class="t16">
						Liking being talked to doesn't help when girls like to talk. What scares me the most is how I sense the same thing that I'm going through about p38 beginning to happen with other people. There are other people that are nice to me that I haven't been around as much that I just know will go down the same path unless I can find a way to change how I think about it. I'm really hoping I can keep this from happening; it takes a lot out of me to be so worried &amp; conflicted especially over something so ridiculous.
					</section>
					<section>
						I've wondered how p38 will react to this entry when she reads it. I know she'll read it because who doesn't want to read an autobiography about someone they used to know who even became famous? Her response will probably be somewhere along the lines of surprised, sad that it's caused me so much trouble, &amp; maybe a little awkward. However, if she somehow got a hold of this now (which is so extremely unlikely that it's hardly worth mentioning because there's no way I would <em>ever</em> let anyone get to this until it's published, &amp; I know how to keep things a secret), I suspect there would be a whole lot more awkwardness going around.
					</section>
					<section>
						Up until this point, my fears of what would happen if someone found this were unjustified; it wouldn't be the most comfortable thing in the world, but there wasn't much anyone could do to me over the facts &amp; opinions written. Now, I can only imagine the horrors that would ensue.
					</section>
					<section>
						People seem to think of me like I'm not real in the sense of they can only imagine me as someone who only works on school work, does geeky stuff in their free-time (which I do but not as ridiculous as they make it out to be), follows the rules exactly, &amp; has non-existent emotions. Anything that conflicts with this unrealistic view comes across as thrilling. Since there aren't many times when people see me go against this view, it continues to be exciting for them. I don't have a problem with people seeing me this way because it allows me to stay being the quiet person that I am &amp; yet people keep talking to me to see if there's something they can dig up that challenges how they think of me. I think something else that lets this continue is that, although I'm quiet, I'm not so quiet that I'm unapproachable. This isn't the only reason people talk to me, but it's a major one. Luckily, no one is mean about it or pries, but I would have to be pretty oblivious to not know what they're trying to do. There are people who would do anything to get a hold of this because of how I pour myself out into it &amp; especially because of an entry as juicy as this.
					</section>
					<section>
						You may wonder why I'm writing this entry &amp; going to publish it if I'm so scared of people reading it. In case you weren't paying attention at the beginning of this, I'm not really sure. I'm not the most comfortable doing things without solid reasoning, but as I continue thinking about why I would do this, I can only come up with that I just want to get it out. Not being forced to directly speak to someone about it puts me at enough ease that I don't feel the need to suppress stuff (which I'm very good at) when I'm writing in here. Something like 80% of every single thing I do (counting when I'm at home) is based off of what I think others might think about me. The main reason that 20% even exists is because I'm left alone often. My conformity decreases with an increasing seriousness of a matter, but a large majority of my life is still governed by my ridiculous fears of the thoughts of others.
					</section>
					<section>
						One person I'm particularly scared of finding this is p1. Not even p38 is at the top of my fearful of this being found by list even if it was relatively likely that she would find it. P1 would want to talk all about it &amp; he would force me to participate. Also, this journal could never be secret again because he would probably want to be updated on what I'm writing in here which could also cause me to not write everything I feel. Of course, I can't be sure of all of this, &amp; p1 would tell you he would hardly do any of that, but I don't think I'm too far off. I realize it may not be the best idea to say that in here when I know he's going to read this eventually, but if goes back to my reasoning of just wanting to get it out, &amp; hopefully, by the time p1 reads this, it will be so long ago that he doesn't care for parts that apply &amp; since I'll be moved out, he won't want to waste much time talking about this. <span class="h-u2">It will stink if it doesn't end up this way.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						People finding this journal isn't the only thing I'm afraid of. I'm pretty sure that there's something between a 25-50% chance that I'll end up in the same math class as p38. As more time goes by, it gets harder for me to tell if it's getting easier for me to deal with all of this becase I'm convincing myself to not think so ridiculously of if it's because there's more time separating me from it which wouldn't prevent it from happening again when I go back to school. I'm actually thinking it's the second option, but I'm desperately hoping I'm making a wrong assumption. It will be such a shame to not be able to enjoy p38 being nice if I end up in the same math class as her. I wish that, when I come to the conclusion that something is ridiculous or pointless, I could purge my mind of all my thoughts of that ridiculous or pointless thing.
					</section>
					<section class="t12">
						One thing I'm glad for, though, is that I can keep this all on the inside. I would hardly ever have a carefree thought again throughout my entire high school career if people could tell this is what I think. It would be unbearably awkward, &amp; the only thing that can never be beat out by awkwardness for things I want to avoid is death. The only thing that can beat out death is more death, so I'd say awkwardness is a major thing I want to prevent. What makes it even worse is that I always make myself feel bad for feeling awkward because I think I'm overreacting (which I usually am. It's extremely easy to make me feel awkward, but I don't think it shows through unless you know when &amp; how to look for it). So not only do I feel awkward, but I also feel bad for feeling awkward. It's not fun.
					</section>
					<section>
						At this point, unless you're one of the people who know me, you're probably getting tired of me going on &amp; on about stuff I feel, so you'll be happy to know I'm running out of things to say. You can be sure that I'll tell you the results when I go back to school, but I don't know what else I could possibly add, &amp; besides, even I'm getting tired of writing about this. Hopefully everything works out.

						I'm about to kill the people running the website that gives me a German credit.
					</section>
					<section>
						For awhile, there has been turmoil in the German class. Most of the problems arose from trying to fit 180 lessons into less than 60 days over the summer. At first I thought I would have to fit 360 lessons into less than 60 days, but <span class="person p57">one of the people keeping track of me</span> (called p57.extra1) told me that the lessons aren't given out one session at a time (there are 2) like a normal person would do, &amp; instead, all the lessons are given out at once &amp; generally need to be finished by the end of session 2. (I'm getting to that generally part.) With that said, I figured I had to do just under 4 lessons a day to get finished by the end. That's just enough lessons in a day to have it be possible to finish them but use up the majority of the day doing so. I could go 2 or 3 times faster than I do, but I retain more of it when I go slower, &amp; when I take the extra time to go more in-depth about something, I understand it so much better &amp; don't slow down every time I see it because I don't know why it's like that. Back to the generally by the end of session 2, there is apparently a cutoff to session 1 where I have to finish the first of 4 parts which was today.
					</section>
					<section>
						Now it's time to get into why I'm about to kill the people running the website that gives me a German credit. After getting past the initial problems, p57.extra1 would continue to call me some days to see if everything was alright. I'm not sure if she does that with everyone, but I wouldn't be too surprised if she did. Not too long ago, she called &amp; said session 1 would be ending on Friday (today). It's a good thing she told me that or else <span class="e-o2">I would have ridiculously thought that it would end on the date plainly stated for all to see on website that I registered on (30<sup>th</sup>).</span> I guess they just pick whatever weekday is closest without going over. Anyway, I have to battle p1 for the only working computer, so it's hard to get work done. The deadline was approaching, &amp; I thought (&amp; planned that) I would get done early, but battling p1 made sure that I wouldn't be able to breeze by anything. Also, we had to go places which ate away at time. Yesterday, I didn't get to the computer until fairly late, but I was determined to finish Part 1 (the part I would be graded on out of 4) that day &amp; certainly before the 11:00am (the am was inferred) cutoff today. To put a stop to those hopes, the people running the website decided it would be a great time to shut the website down for maintenance. They tell you an hour beforehand, but I would prefer them to tell us at least at the beginning of the day it's going to happen which could have averted the tragic ending to this story. I tried to whiz by the last few lessons but was stopped before I could get to the unit test, the big end-of-part exam, &amp; the small course survey. Although I was frustrated at not being able to finish, I didn't get too upset because I still had today until 11:00am. I planned on getting up early (before noon) to give me some extra time, but I'll admit that didn't go exactly as planned. Nonetheless, I still had time left, &amp; I went to work on the unit test. Almost all the questions on all the tests are multiple choice &amp; what isn't, isn't too long which is why I wasn't too intimidated. I finished the unit test just after 11 &amp; sent it in. It wasn't really specified what would happen if I sent stuff from Part 1 in after 11, so I just assumed there was a cutoff for Session 1 so the teachers (which don't really teach) could put together something like a progress report. Surely I would have been told if something bad would happen.
					</section>
					<section>
						<del>In the meantime</del> <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/1/20">While finishing up the part</span>, I was determined to get everything done right then &amp; there. I didn't get up for <em>anything</em>; not to eat, not to go to the bathroom, not to get a drink or stretch. Nothing. The only time I got up was to answer the home phone when p1 called, &amp; then I went right back to work. This was particularly noticeable when I got to the end-of-part exam. I had no idea they would ask me to type a huge research report on a famous German person (in English). I slaved away at that thing for hours upon hours, once again, not getting up for anything. In the end, I had a 4-paragraph report finished on Albert Einstein. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/1/20">(Yes, it does take me hours upon hours of nonstop work for me to finish a 4-paragraph research report.)</span> While thinking that it was ridiculous how I had to finish something that normally takes at least a week in one day, I was relieved it was finally over &amp; approached the button to re-enter the test to attach the Word document as I anticipated the short course review &amp; then freedom. Once I clicked on the button, my greatest horror was realized. A small box appeared in the middle of the screen stating that the grades have already been entered &amp; can no longer be altered... (This is me letting it sink in.) ...
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2024/1/20">
						Having since experienced much worse situations and gotten used to expecting things online to shut off immediately at the deadline, these events don't seems nearly as shocking and infuriating to me now as they did at the time, but in my defence, I'm pretty sure this was the first time I had ever needed to turn in anything online, and I even may not have ever experienced late work not being accepted. I remember thinking how strange it was that something could be turned in for full credit at one moment but then not even accepted just one second later. I grew up at a time when it was a reasonable question to ask the class if they had internet access, and although that time was passing by the time I started going to high school, you can see by how I was competing with p1 for the only computer that my family was slow to move into the internet age, so I wasn't very familiar with the standards of that age. Also, that online course legitimately did have a lot of problems that weren't at all related to my familiarity with online courses (as I soon state), so let's not pretend like the source of all of the issues was from me.
					</section>
					<section>
						I can't believe they did this to me! I clicked the button a few more times not knowing what else to do; I was wondering why the grade they show on the home screen dropped from a 96% to an 87%. It would be one thing if no one ever called me from the website headquarters, &amp; I had to figure this out one my own, but the fact that someone did &amp; didn't tell me what would happen makes it all the worse. There are so many things I could have been told to avert this scenario:
					</section>
					<ol>
						<li>You get a zero on all stuff not finished.</li>
						<li>The end-of-part exam is a gigantic research report that normally takes a week to finish.</li>
						<li>The website is going to shut down for maintenance the day before the end of Session 1, so hurry up.</li>
					</ol>
					<section>
						If I was told <em style="text-decoration:underline">any</em> of this, this whole crisis could have been avoided. In addition, if I was at least notified when it was too late, I could have been working on lessons in the next part or doing frivolous things such as eating, going to the bathroom, or moving more than 2 inches in my chair.
					</section>
					<section class="t6 t23">
						Also, I don't know if they add grades to my permanent record each semester like they do here. (The website is based in a different state.) Now that we moved to this school district, I don't have nearly as many problems with homework, &amp; because of that, my grades went up. I got a 4.0 grade point average which I never thought I could get last year. Since 9<sup>th</sup> grade is the first grade where stuff really sticks with you, I got here just in time to get an untainted 4.0. If that unfair B is added to my grade point average, I will never be able to get it higher than something like 3.9 unless I take weighted courses. I will <em style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</em> let that happen. <span class="t1">Remember how I said that if I say something is happening, it's happening? This is one of those scenarios.</span> If that grade brings my GPA down, they are going to have to answer to me. I am a very mild person all the time, but don't you get in my way when I'm that passionate about something. I was really proud of myself for getting ranked top in my class (people can be tied for first), &amp; <em>no one</em> is going to take that away from me unless it's my fault which this doesn't qualify as.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although I was at first wondering if an exception should really be made, I think they ought to at least let me turn in the report that is <em>already finished</em>. If I would get a score of at least 34/90 (which is a horrible F) my grade would be brought back up to an A. Now that I know all this ridiculous stuff is going to happen next time, it's not like I'm going to let it happen again. Surely making one exception for something that wasn't my fault wouldn't be that big of a deal. I have <em>NEVER</em> come across a website with this many problems. Ever. That's not an exaggeration. There are typos everywhere, a bunch of the details of what's being taught is somewhat inconsistent or explained badly, the questions are worded in the worst way possible on the tests assuming you can tell it's a question, &amp; there are a bunch of questions that just plain have the wrong answer (if you could understand the question). I can deal with <em>all</em> of this, but once you start messing with my grade like that, that's where I draw the line. I'm going to make a reign of terror if my GPA is affected. <span class="person p57">My advisor</span> is supposed to call me the Monday after this coming one. You can be sure she's going to hear about all of this.

						<span class="person p57">My advisor</span> still hasn't called. This isn't the first time she decided not to call. It's as if she knows that I'm going to tell her about the problems I have with this website &amp; is avoiding me. To make things worse, I know I've been not getting my 4 lessons a day done everyday, so I re-did my math; I now have to do 5 lessons a day to get finished. That's <em>really</em> pushing the limits of what I can accomplish in one day. German all day every day doesn't hold much appeal. If I didn't really want a full credit of German, I don't think I could go on. I'm hoping I can keep it together for the last 21 days. Maybe I ought to keep track of how many seconds are left so it seems shorter &amp; is more fun.

						In less serious news, last night wasn't the most comfortable of nights. I couldn't fall asleep for awhile, so I was in bed still aware of my surroundings. Eventually I started feeling a tingling on my foot. Naturally, I assumed it was due to me barely touching the edge of my covers which are at the end of my bed because it's too hot. I knew that if I touched more of my covers it wouldn't feel so weird, so I started moving my foot around to find them. Once I started moving my foot, it seemed to me that the tingling didn't move quite like sheets did, &amp; about the same time as I touched the <em>real</em> edge of my sheets is when I realized the bug-like nature of what was on top of me. I frantically shook my foot to get whatever was on me off which was when I discovered it had some weight to it. Luckily, I got it off, &amp; <span class="h-o2">when I landed from jumping 10 feet into the air</span>, I turned on the light to see what it was. What do I see on the edge of my bed but a cricket. I was glad it wasn't a giant spider, but it was still creepy. After a moment of hesitation, I decided to try to take it outside, but it got away. I don't know what would possess a cricket to go through all of that trouble to get on my bed just to freak me out. Although not much else happened, I think it's needless to say that I didn't get to sleep too easily after that.

						Today, I messaged p57.extra1 through the website about how she hadn't called &amp; that I had problems with the end of part 1, &amp; she ended up calling not too long later. She was surprisingly nice &amp; calm about it; she even volunteered to let me turn in my finished report before I even suggested it. I think she could tell I was upset about what had happened &amp; decided to be particularly nice. I'm glad I held back on saying all that I could have said like I usually do (hold it back) because I would have felt bad to say how horrible they were &amp; then have her be nice to me. The conversation went a lot more smoothly than I thought it would. Since this has been resolved, I feel a lot less tense. Like I said, I can deal with all that other ridiculous stuff (although I'm not looking forward to 5 lessons a day). On Monday, band camp starts for 2 weeks. I'm still hoping I can make it the last 20 days.

						The torture is finally over! Technically, it was over at 3pm on Wednesday, but I hadn't gotten around to this until now.
					</section>
					<section>
						After all the pain &amp; suffering, I managed to get a half of a German credit. Why only half you ask? Because, although I did more than half, I didn't get the rest finished. Fitting a year-long class into 2 months is difficult especially under these circumstances. To give you a better idea of how hard it is, let me tell you those circumstances. Since I've already gone through a year of Spanish, it will be easiest to compare to that. There are 180 "daily" lessons in the course. There are only 174 school days in a year, &amp; there are some early release days in that. The reason they are called "daily" lessons is because normal people take the course during the school year. That version isn't sponsored for us. On top of there only being 174 school days instead of 180, I don't even have Spanish every day. The class ends up being longer, but we don't do more than a lesson's worth. In addition, we were never assigned gigantic writing assignments. Now imagine all of that extra work we don't do crunched into a little less than 2 months. But that's not all. As I have said before, there was a bunch of wrong &amp; inconsistent stuff in the course. Also, in the beginning, I tried to memorize each word &amp; the things that go along with them which took more time than nearly skimming. <span class="e-o2">How silly of me.</span> Along with all of that, I had to try to get through p1 to get to get to the computer which is nearly impossible. When the other computer was finally fixed, it decided it hadn't tortured me enough &amp; slowly began to work less &amp; less. Once the 2 weeks worth of band camp which lasts 6 hours started (I'll talk about band camp later), I had an especially difficult time completing the necessary lessons. As you can imagine, I don't have thoughts of German every waking moment which also didn't help me do the German class every waking moment like I needed to. Although I really wanted a full German credit, the universe was obviously determined to keep it from happening, so I only got half.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						For the record, I got over 75% of the course finished, but there were holes in what I did (not every assignment for every lesson was finished), &amp; this school district only does grades by semester ... I think. I say I think because of the ridiculous confusion surrounding this course. The person I'm supposed to talk to about it is <span class="p0">my counselor</span>. The problem is, they don't even know that an online summer course exists until I tell them. When I finally get to ask them the question I went there to ask (in the few times I'm able to come in contact with my changing counselors), they say I should consult Grandview (the school district I register through). Counterdictory to that, p57.extra1 said Grandview has nothing to do with it &amp; only sends a transcript to my district. If my school district is supposed to be the one in charge of this stuff &amp; yet they're telling me someone else is, something's telling me I'm not going to get many answers. <span class="p0">My counselor</span> said that I definitely can't get &#190; of a credit, but said I need to ask Grandview if I get any credit at all since it's an online course. These people are going to drive me crazy. I better get half of a credit.
					</section>
					<section>
						I hope things are smoother next year (yes, I plan to do it again. How else am I going to get credit for a class not taught?), but I just know they won't. There are certain things that they seemed confident in answering, but I just know are going to fall apart next year. All I can do is hope for the best. At least now I get to relax &amp; have fun (until school starts in less than 2 weeks).

						On Sunday, we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meramec_Caverns">Meramec Caverns</a>. You may ask, "If you went to Meramec Caverns on Sunday, why didn't you write about it then?" That's a reasonable question. Other than just not getting around to it, it's also due to the fact that most entries of much length at all take more than one day to write. I can't start another entry if I haven't finished the last one can I? There are other things I like to do more than write in this, &amp; I avoid writing in this while my parents are around because I'd prefer that no one know about this until it's published. The only one I think even notices I write in here is p2 increasingly rarely, &amp; she thinks I'm writing a story. I like writing stories too, but I can't possibly do everything at once. So anyway, that's what's going on.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="display-left" src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Meramec Caverns %2301.jpg" style="width:14em">
						Meramec Caverns was cool. I thought 60&deg;F would be cold in summer, but it wasn't; I ended up regretting bringing a jacket I had to carry around with me the whole time. For a long time, we just walked around in uninteresting tunnels which the tour guide said were made of dolomite. The tour guide turned off lights behind us, so you couldn't be too slow. Eventually we got to interesting stalactites &amp; stalagmites in a low-ceilinged room behind a glass barrier. The path stopped before we went too far into the cave, &amp; when we turned around, we took a different path which had better sights. We were told some animals lived further down. They probably didn't want us to disturb them. So unfair. Going through the tunnels, I saw moss growing on rocks right next to a light. It was funny.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="display-right" src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Stalactites (R).jpg" style="width:14em">
						There are only so many words to describe cave rock formations. Some were long &amp; fat, &amp; some were short &amp; skinny. Some were high on the ceiling, &amp; some you almost had to duck to miss. There was water in a bunch of places, &amp; stalagmites came up from a few of them. At one formation, different colored lights were shown on the rocks. One room used to have water in it &amp; below that water level, there were a bunch of spherical rocks attached to each other. They called it the wine room (one of the reasons being because of the "grapes"). There was also a rock formation towards the middle of the room with 3, small columns holding up another grape-like structure that went flat at the previous water level &amp; had 3, small stalagmites sticking up from it. In the last room, there were a bunch of long stalactites making up their own wall. They had a big lightshow on it while music was playing, &amp; at the end, they showed an image of the United States flag. The tour was over after that, &amp; we were walked back.
					</section>
					<section>
						Our day wasn't over after that, though. Within the area around Meramec Caverns is something called the <a href="https://www.cavemanzipline.com/">Caveman Zipline</a>. P2 was against going to it because of the cost, but p1 really, really wanted to go. Eventually we went to it &amp; had to sign, among other things, a gigantic agreement basically saying that, yes, we're healthy enough to do this, &amp; if we die or something, it's not their fault (we didn't die). We had to take a short course to make sure we knew what we were doing. After that, we started walking up a gigantic tower to get to the zipline.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						As I looked out at the really long zipline far above the parking lot &amp; Meramec River going into the woods, I felt my fear of heights setting in. I've been getting better at hiding things that scare me, but I still wasn't looking forward to it. When it was finally time for me to go, I did everything I could to not think about what was going on &amp; just focused on the cable keeping me from falling to my death. On the other side, there were a few other smaller ziplines, &amp; the zipline going back was longer than the first one. I managed to keep my cool all the way through.
					</section>
					<section class="t3 t10">
						At the end of the last zipline, there was a photographer to get a picture of people's expressions. My expression was very blank because of trying to push down my fear; p1 wasn't happy about it. If there's one thing p1 dislikes about me more than anything other than me not immediately doing exactly what he says without question is being shy &amp; keeping things to myself. It's really sad because I'd consider that to be my dominant personality trait. He was telling me how bad I was for trying to hide how much "fun" I was having like I always do. If the conversation had continued long enough, I would have told him I didn't look thrilled because I was scared to death but it didn't. I don't like being scared of anything, &amp; maybe when I'm on my own, I'll do the things that scare me a whole lot to get over it but that doesn't change things now. <span class="t23">I know I conceal my emotions a lot, but that's because I'm scared of not giving the perfect reaction or impression which portrays exactly the right thing;</span> I shouldn't be told off for it.

						Anyway, that was the end of our time at Meramec Caverns. It was a full day.

					<section>
						So I'm back at school. Technically, school started on August 14, but I haven't gotten around to this entry until now. Besides, now I can give a better overview instead of my first impressions. This is going to be a long one, so get ready.
					</section>
					<section>
						I'll begin with the bus. This year, I can tell how old everyone is that's younger than me. Before, I couldn't tell whether someone was in 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> grade, but now, everyone who was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade goes to Riverbend which is only for 8<sup>th</sup> graders, &amp; everyone who was in 6<sup>th</sup> stayed at the middle school. There are only 2 people that go to Riverbend in the morning now &amp; only 3 on the way back. For at least one day, I want them to be gone, so we can skip Riverbend altogether. There are tons of new 6<sup>th</sup> graders. Although only one new stop was added, 6<sup>th</sup> graders must make up almost half of the bus. I don't know how something like that happens.
					</section>
					<section>
						As I said before, I'll tell you about the pointless internal struggle regarding p38. This year, I don't have any classes with her, so I only see her in the halls &amp; at lunch every once in a while. I can tell that not coming in much contact with her is causing any ridiculous thoughts to go away, even since the beginning of the school year. For awhile, I had a whole bunch to say on this topic, but I find myself with not as much anymore because it's going away.
					</section>
					<section class="t14">
						I need more friends. I don't think I'd have these problems if I did. When we moved school districts going into middle school, I'm certain I had a decent amount of friends by the 2<sup>nd</sup> year. I don't remember that period of time well enough to tell what I did to make that happen, but I know I was more out-going then. Being less quiet to attract more friends would help prevent me from clinging so much (internally) to the people that are nice &amp; try to break me out of my very thick shell. I don't think it would <em>completely</em> solve things <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/2/28">regarding my attachment to girls</span> because I'm realistic, &amp; since I've been getting older, it stands to reason that hormones are playing a role in this although I <em>seriously</em> doubt that it's the only factor or even the dominant factor. <span class="t23">I hope whoever I end up being with in the future is okay with me having had a ridiculous response to someone who just tried to make me feel comfortable.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t24">
						In other news, you may be wondering about what happened with the German club. That dream has been crushed. At first everything seemed to be going great; I was getting things planned out, I ended up getting <span class="person p58">one of my sponsors</span> as my Academic Advisory teacher even though I don't have them as a regular teacher, I had recruited <span class="p0">a 3<sup>rd</sup> sponsor</span> for the club, &amp; to top it off, <span class="person p59">an exchange student from Germany</span> ended up in <span class="person p60">my previous Spanish teacher</span>'s class (one of my sponsors). What could have gone wrong you ask? Well, circumstances that made me doubt how often the club could meet caused me to ask p56.extra1 that question, &amp; his response was once a month. The club was destroyed right then &amp; there. I held off making it official, hoping for a miracle, but it never came. I was told the club could meet any time before of after school instead of during Academic Advisory, but my parents can't really drive me many places, &amp; my bus arrives kind-of late &amp; leaves early. I know I also said this was happening too, but I assure you, these failures with that sort of determination are exceptions, not the rule.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although the German club proved to be a waste of time, I still thought it would be interesting to meet the German exchange student because I hadn't &amp; wouldn't since there wasn't going to be a German club. It's not every day that you can meet someone from another country &amp; can help you learn another language. I told p60 (my previous Spanish teacher) about it, &amp; she wanted to bring the person over during class so she wouldn't forget, but I pushed for it being after class since I was only a few rooms down the hall &amp; it would be less awkward. It didn't work. She said that it would be okay &amp; that she would do everything, but it didn't help much. During class, p60 came in &amp; asked if I could come out. When I did, she introduced me to p59 (p59.pronunciation.name, I'm pretty sure I spelled it right, a girl of course). In the very short meeting, she said that she was in my Chemistry class. Although I didn't show it, I was really surprised. I had no idea. I don't know how I could have missed something like that. You would think anyone would be able to pick up on someone from another country but apparently not. There wasn't much more to the meeting, &amp; I went back to class.
					</section>
					<section class="t16 t23">
						The only problem I have with having girls as friends is that I can't tell whether I'm thinking of them as just friends or as something more &amp; if it's okay that I am (you already know what happens in a scenario like that). This creates a lot of problems when the majority of people that talk to me are girls (I'm telling you, it's completely true. I still don't know why). Hopefully, I'll eventually get over it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, sure enough, the next time I went to science, I found p59 sitting in the third desk behind mine. I still don't know how I didn't notice that. I must have stood no more than 2 feet away from her at least once while asking <span class="person p61">the teacher</span> questions. <span class="t13">Once I set my stuff down, I went over &amp; asked her the German questions I had carefully planned out in my mind, a process which has been repeated every time before science class since then.</span> She's nice &amp; speaks with a German accent, but it's not too bad. However, she speaks fairly quietly a bunch of the time (which I'll admit I do too), &amp; it's hard to tell what she's saying through the accent.
					</section>
					<section>
						When she tries to answer my questions, I notice 2 things. 1: she wasn't really taught much about her language just like here which should be a fundemental part of our education (&amp; they wonder why so many people are illiterate) &amp; 2: although she gets by well in normal conversation, she doesn't know enough words to adequately explain something fully in the way she wants to. I told her she could write down a word in German that I could look-up later if she felt like I needed it to better understand, but something's telling me that she's not going to do that. She seems to do everything she can to not do anything that would inconvenience anyone in any way because of how she's not an expert at English. It's okay with me that she's not an expert at English especially because I can understand what it's like since I'm learning Spanish &amp; German, &amp; plan to learn more languages.
					</section>
					<section class="t22">
						It was surprising how fast p59 included me in her circle of friends since I opened up dialogue by asking her questions on German. I was especially surprised when there was a group activity in class, &amp; she came over actively trying to get me to join her group before <span class="person p61">the teacher</span> was even done talking. I've seen people doing that with others before, but I don't remember anyone ever doing thatfor me (although I don't think it's too unlikely that I was one of those people years &amp; years ago). It's not like I was the only friend she had in the class; she's been accumulating friends close to where she sits. It wasn't a 2-person activity, so they were in the group too.
					</section>
					<section class="t14 t24">
						It's really sad when a person from another continent fits in better than you. p59 doesn't necessarily better understand what America is like than me, it's just that she finds her niche of people who happily integrate her &amp; converse with her in an easy &amp; flowing manner which is more than I can say. I don't have a lack of people willing to do that stuff for me; I just don't quickly sieze the opportunity, &amp; people usually decide I'd rather be alone before I feel comfortable enough &amp; they learn otherwise. The point is, she's doing pretty well which is good, &amp; it's nice that she hasn't just left me in the dirt.
					</section>
					<section class="t14">
						As I think about these "tragic" events that keep me lonely, I think more &amp; more that I should make some changes (which I've always known I should, but it never got too serious because I wasn't nearly completely alone). I've only gotten less out-going over the years, &amp; I need to do something about it. I'm not saying I'm going to suddenly become some super talkative person or even get very out-going at all, but I know when a certain circumstance is able to lead to a less lonely future. Let me give you a few examples. Rather than smile a tiny bit &amp; wave when someone says hi, I could actually say hi back. Rather than hold in every comment I have about a person, I could force myself to say a few of the more joking ones. Rather than keeping quiet in a conversation directed at a group of people I'm in or within the group, I could maybe try to find a place where I can add something. Rather than cringing away so much when someone intentionally comes in contact with me because I like my personal space &amp; it's weird (such as p38 poking me), I could not respond if it's short &amp; only move farther away if it lasts. I need to do something, so I'm not lonely forever. Also, I feel bad when people try to break me out of my shell &amp; it doesn't work which is the dumbest problem anyone can ever have because <em>I'm</em> the reason it's not working, &amp; I <em>want</em> them to break me out of my shell. It's just ridiculous. I feel awkward really easily &amp; want to make absolutely sure I'm not doing anything even a little wrong, so I don't know how much of this I'll follow through on, but being so lonely is wearing me down.
					</section>
					<section>
						Things are very much the same at school this year. 5 out of 8 of my classes are the same hour as they were last year. My math class even has almost all of the same people in it (although it isn't the same hour).
					</section>
					<section>
						It's marching season in band, &amp; it's going pretty well. 2 new freshmen, p62 &amp; p63, decided they'd try to befriend me. Something about band causes me to not be so stiff. Maybe it's because we're doing something that I can talk about, but there's nothing determining what I should do except in a loose sense. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/2/29">(There's stuff to talk about and not much preventing me from bringing it up.)</span> I hope I don't mess it up.
					</section>
					<section>
						Science is once again extremely easy &amp; boring. One thing different, though, is that <span class="person p61">the science teacher</span> is actually willing to answer my questions. Typically, my science teachers have not seemed very interested in science. I always want to expand my scientific knowledge, &amp; my science teachers never encourage that whatsoever. I think this one is different. The problem is, I can't ask science questions &amp; German questions at the same time.
					</section>
					<section>
						This year, my English teacher doesn't seem as strict as English teachers normally are which is also good.
					</section>
					<section>
						Spanish is once again going to be a waste of a class period because <span class="h3">I know literally everything they're teaching</span>. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span>

								I've read far ahead of where Spanish II is which is why I already know this stuff.

								The Spanish classes were paced so that each year would take you through half of the Spanish textbook. I read through both books multiple times (which took me through Spanish IV), and I even managed to get my hands on a third book which I mostly read through before I lost my interest in Spanish. I focused mainly on the grammar rules, so I wasn't quite learning <em>everything</em>, but there wasn't much left, and it would only take me a day or so to memorize the list of new vocabulary words when they came up in class.
							</section>
						</aside>
						Spanish is already painfully slow, so learning absolutely nothing new except for some vocabulary words doesn't help. I ask <span class="person p64">the Spanish teacher</span> more advanced questions, but it's not enough. I want two credits of Spanish before I move on to French (the only other language taught here) which is why I voluntarily went into this abyss of boredom.

						P.E. is this year because, like I said last year, they left out social studies, &amp; I had to figure out what I was going to put off. Once again, I've gained the reputation of fastest runner. In reality, I'm pretty sure that I only have somewhat better natural ability &amp; that I seem so much better than everyone else because I actually try all the time. Naturally, this year, most of the people are a year younger than me, but I've always been one of the fastest. I'm also pretty good at other physical activities too which is why I wonder why there are always a bunch of people picked before me to be on someone's team. I know it has to do with those people being friends, but you would think that they would at least sometimes get tired of losing &amp; pick people based on how good they are. A few people have tried to recuit me to do track, but they hardly do anymore because I'm not giving any sort of definite answer. I don't think it would be too bad to join track, but it would take up a lot of time, &amp; I guess I need people to make it seem like they would really want me to be there before I give up a large part of my free-time.
					</section>
					<section>
						In P.E., another girl, of course, p65, decided she'd try to break me out of my shell &amp; made it her job to get me to say hi. I can't remember if this next part happened before or after the date I have at the beginning of this entry, but it was really close. One day, I did say hi to her (as opposed to waving silently) because it would make her happy, &amp; I didn't want her to decide it's a lost cause. After that, she moved on to trying to get me to say, "What's up?" At that point, I told her how I actually can speak &amp; then a mostly one-sided started (not my side) about wondering about why I'm so quiet. Towards the end, <span class="p0">the one person that was in my grade</span> &amp; had already given up on getting me to talk said how she should just let me be. p65 then said how she would leave me alone, &amp; I, yet again, had driven someone away. She's still nice to me &amp; seems as though she still wants to get me to talk but keeps her distance because she doesn't want to become annoying. Hopefully, I can salvage this in the drawn-out, hardly noticeable way that I do.
					</section>
					<section>
						My last class is History just like last year. I even have <span class="person p47">the same teacher</span> even though she only started teaching World History this year. Other than history, she likes to talk about things such as how she ate her goat because it wouldn't eat the right weeds, what she would do in the event of a zombie apocalypse, &amp; her critiques on various action-packed movies. It makes for an interesting class.
					</section>
					<section>
						If you'll notice the date of this entry, you'll know it's the anniversary of 9-11. I was wondering if p59 knew what it was, but I heard quiet voices behind me while it was being talked about over the intercom, so I think she was told. It's depressing. My mind has a way of shielding me from getting too upset, but it's still sad. The part that gets me the most is how a bunch of people jumped out of the buildings when they knew they couldn't make it out. <span class="h-u3">It's not the most comfortable sight.</span> I think it's just ridiculous how some people would do that; it's not right. What also isn't right is hating all Muslims because the psychopaths that did it happened to have that religion. People need to learn to dislike only the people who do bad things &amp; not everyone who shares a quality with them.
					</section>
					<section>
						The new World Trade Center is just about finished. It looks pretty cool, and from what it sounds like on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(American_TV_program)">Nova</a>, they're going to have a hard time doing damage to it even if they run another plane into it. I think it's good that we're rebuilding there &amp; that we also have a memorial. Let's hope we don't need to do it again.

						Two days ago, the band went to a contest. The contest is a thing where we perform our half-time show, &amp; judges score how well we do. It took about 3 hours for the 3 busses to get to the place. We parked on a not too big parking lot, &amp;, after we got our instruments from the trailer, attempted to practice a little in between the other busses &amp; bands. It didn't work well.
					</section>
					<section>
						It was interesting to see other bands. A few of them had purple &amp; white colors for their school like us, &amp; we complimented each other on the good choice of colors.
					</section>
					<section>
						From the parking lot, we marched down a street to a place where we waited outside a football field to go on. When it was finally our time, we marched to the back of the field. As we marched on to take our places, the whole right half of our formation began to lag behind because we didn't know which of the more than normal lines to stop on. We figured it out, but I could feel our points going down on the spot.
					</section>
					<section>
						People clapped after we finished performing, &amp; we marched off. We stayed afterwards to watch other bands perform. They were pretty good &amp; some of them marched in cool ways in certain parts to go with the music. After a while, we made our way back to the busses &amp; left. On the way out, another band yelled good-bye to us from their busses which was funny.
					</section>
					<section>
						The bus ride back was about the same as the bus ride there except it was darker, &amp; it wasn't raining as much. Speaking of rain, I think somewhere along the trip there, the right windshield wiper of the bus fell off. It was weird watching a little stub go back &amp; forth. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.
					</section>
					<section>
						In the end, I got home around 9:00. They said they'll tell us how the judges scored us when they tell them. I don't think we did too bad, but I'm not getting my hopes up. At least it wasn't that bad taking the trip.

						On Saturday (a week ago), my cousin p66 got married. It was quite different, &amp; you would have a hard time trying to find something traditional. The first thing different was where the marriage was held. The reception was in a big, abandoned cotton mill &amp; the wedding was outside. There was apparently an art show that is held there every year which we didn't see much of, but it comes into play later. The dresses that were worn were certainly interesting; the bridesmaids (her sisters) all had swirly, temporary tatoos on their hands &amp; arms &amp; had peacock feathers on their heads &amp; faces. <span class="p0">One person</span> looked like a big, red tree without leaves. p66 was dressed in white with really elaborate swirly, temporary tatoos (they called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna">henna</a> painting), &amp; where wings would have been if she had dressed like an angel, she had something like white branches. The groom, p67 (his nickname is p67.extra1 because he has a long moustache that he curls into a circle on each side), was dressed in a suit with a top hat.
					</section>
					<section>
						The "preacher" was <span class="p0">one of their friends</span> who passed an online course to give a wedding. He used a megaphone to give the ceremony. There wasn't much structure to the wedding, so it was kind-of hard to tell what was going on. I haven't been to too many weddings, so I'm not exactly sure what a completely normal wedding is, but I'm pretty sure the things said during the ceremony were fairly normal. Afterwards, we got a flower petal &amp; a white rose to throw into the Mississippi River. Most of the people in the wedding joined the art festival people in a parade to the river. The most interesting part was the bikes that were covered to look like giant sea turtles which moved their heads &amp; front fins while they moved. We eventually made it down to the river &amp; threw the flowers in. The people from the art festival threw in a bunch of other stuff which made me wonder what happens to that polluting, non-biodegradable stuff.
					</section>
					<section>
						After standing around not doing much, we went back to the reception. There wasn't much to eat which made me sad, but there were weird, multicolored balls of cake on sticks &amp; covered in icing. They weren't all the same type of cake, &amp; since they were covered in icing, you couldn't really tell what type you were getting.
					</section>
					<section>
						Not much else happened except for people talking, so we eventually left. At night, a giant, wooden art thing was burned, but we didn't have a bunch of stuff to do for hours to use up that time, &amp; we live too far away from where the wedding was held to go back.

						Yesterday was my p68's <span class="person p69">daughter</span>'s Halloween party. That may sound like a strange, possibly unsafe thing to go to (because of not too well-known adults at a fairly private event), but I assure you, it was fine. This was my (&amp; my parents') 2<sup>nd</sup> time going.
					</section>
					<section>
						After about the first half of October is over, my p68 starts trying to get people to go to <span class="person p69">her daughter</span>'s Halloween party which is mostly centered around a walkway through her wooded backyard where people are meant to be scared. She plans it to be on the Saturday before Halloween. I'm pretty sure there are at least a few other people from the bus that go, but it's my parents' style (mostly p1's, but not always) to arrive at places fashionably late (except without the fashionably part), so I couldn't say definitely. By the time we got there, only a mass of relatives were left.
					</section>
					<section>
						Pretty much right after we arrived, we went into the path. I think this year wasn't quite as scary as last year, but it wasn't too bad. The part that makes it all worth it is watching p2's reactions. She acts like she does when there's a spider coming towards her; she isn't seriously scared but acts pretty ridiculous. The best part of the path was the end. There was a maze set up, &amp; absolutely no light was let in. As you walk around, people placed in the maze scare you, sometimes flashing a light. Once you finally feel your way out of the maze, if you look back at what you were walking through, it's really pathetic how much time is spent in something so small. Almost immediately after we exited the walkway, it was shut down because it was time for it to end.
					</section>
					<section>
						That was pretty much the end of the most interesting stuff. People were crowded around a fire to keep warm even though it wasn't too cold. Food &amp; drinks were outside, so people could eat &amp; drink there. Eventually, someone got out a game where you try to throw beanbags into a hole <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/14">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole">Cornhole</a>)</span>. I got to play for awhile, but there was soon no one to play with. <span class="t13">I decided to juggle with the beanbags (which I'm good at &amp; will likely talk about later)</span> &amp; left soon after. The p68 says it will be better next year, so that will be interesting.

						Today is Halloween! I wish it wouldn't be weird to go trick-or-treating no matter how old you got. I miss costumes &amp; trick-or-treating. One thing I don't miss is going out in the rain like I would have today. Now, not much happens, &amp; it's boring. However, this actually isn't the real reason I decided to write today.
					</section>
					<section class="t22">
						This has been the 3<sup>rd</sup> time p63 (one of the band members who tried to befriend me) decided to sit with me at lunch (&amp; I say 3 times in a row is enough to know that it will keep happening). At first, she would come to my table every once in a while or find me in the stands at the football games the band played at saying that I seemed lonely (which I was). Although her heart was in the right spot, she can't hold an entire conversation by herself like some people I know which was partly why I would try to add some things in the many awkward silences especially because I feel bad for people who try to make me feel included &amp; don't get much of a response. On the last football game, I told her that, although my blank face doesn't show it, I appreciated what she was doing. I think that was a determining factor as to why she decided to begin sitting with me.
					</section>
					<section>
						It turns out that we get along really well. As I learn more about her, I find more &amp; more things we have in common. That's not to say that I can only get along with people like me, but it makes it so much easier to relate &amp; understand each other. I don't think I've talked to anyone so much in years; that's including my parents. I'm sure some of it has to do with not getting it out with other people &amp; having only a relatively short time to talk to her, but I don't think it would be the same without us being so well suited for each other.
					</section>
					<section>
						p63 is nice &amp;, like I said, shares many similarities with me. She says how she doesn't have much of a middle ground &amp; goes from really talkative to awkwardly silent which I have beared witness to plenty of times. (Lately, though, she's been staying at talkative around me.) She has medium-length dark hair with highlights &amp; needs glasses although I don't always see her with them. In order to give you a more complete description of her, she's a little overweight, but it's not that big of a deal. In case you forgot from earlier, she's a freshman which is fine with me; I think it's ridiculous how everyone always makes fun of freshmen. She says that she "has OCD" &amp; can't sit still too long, but I haven't really noticed it.
					</section>
					<section>
						A week ago, which was the 2<sup>nd</sup> time p63 sat with me, p38 decided she'd give me internal struggles (this also reaffirmed that I'm over that ridiculousness, besides, I had to make room for more). I could tell that she was upset when she came over, but based on the way she tried to start conversations completely unrelated to it, I decided she didn't want to talk about it. <span class="t22">I had forgotten how nice she is.</span> She was carrying on conversations, being perfectly polite, &amp; was inquisitive about the new person she hadn't seen me with before. My problem arose when p63 walked away for a short time. <span class="t25">When she was out of earshot, p38 said something like, "Look at you flirting, Robert! I'm proud of you!"</span> After giving her the stare of death, she said how she was kidding, but I don't think she actually was. I was doing such a good job at keeping myself free from thoughts beyond friend involving p63, so I wasn't thrilled to have that taken away from me. The rest of lunch was uneventful, but although I can't be sure, I remember having the slight impression that p38 was emphasizing the fact that she had a boyfriend to show that she wasn't with me &amp; imply that I'm still available.

					<section class="t23">
						You can't even begin to imagine how much those 2 sentences p38 said consumed my every thought. It's a good thing I didn't have much homework because I couldn't concentrate (&amp; still can't to a degree). At first, all I could do was groan internally, but as the days went by, &amp; it went through my head over &amp; over &amp; over again, I slowly began to allow myself to reasonably assess the situation, &amp; in reality, there's probably some truth to it.

					<section>
						On Tuesday, p63 <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span> wasn't at school due to strep throat as I found out later.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">The only reason I can spell her name right is because I asked &amp; later saw it.</aside>
						p38, I think because she saw me alone, made a rare, second trip to sit at my table. Seeing her come over, I just knew what she would want to talk about, but I tried to hold out hope. It didn't last long. Before she even sat down, she asked, "Where's your little girlfriend?" Apparently, the only thing worth talking about was p63. I questioned her girlfriend statement, &amp; she started to reconsider what she said but then decided she liked that the best &amp; stuck with it. Very soon after, she said, "Is she your girlfriend? ... Oh my gosh! She's your girlfriend, isn't she?" I was originally just staring at her <span class="elaborate">for reasons that I'll explain in another entry</span>, but seeing that it was going too far, I told her in a definite way that she wasn't my girlfriend.
						<aside class="reflection t4" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2024/3/17">
							I drag this out for a really long time, and it's nothing too crazy anyway. Basically, I don't want to lie to people, but I also don't want to always expose my secrets, so I avoid potentially problematic questions by staying silent and acting like the person is ridiculous for asking the question. I do this even if I shouldn't be worried about my answer because, if I always answered when it would work out for me but never when it wouldn't, it would be essentially the same as always saying what my answer was.
						</aside>
						She asked me why not &amp; I told her I don't do things that fast. At some point, p38 asked, "But you <em>do</em> like her?" I held out through the multiple times she asked, but it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to come to a conclusion. If I was asked that question now, I would probably make no eye-contact &amp; slowly nod my head in a barely noticeable way. She says that she likes me, but she only knows her from that one meeting at lunch. However, although I don't want to jump to conclusions, I don't think it would take too much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that p63 shares at least some of what I feel.

						I feel so awkward &amp; embarassed, but talking with her makes me so happy. My cheek muscles aren't used to smiling that much. I don't remember ever having 2 emotions so completely mixed. In the exact same moment that I want to put my head down &amp; get rid of all illogical thoughts on the awkward subject, I want to smile &amp; think even more about it. I've always prided myself in being able to separate my emotions (&amp; reasoning) so they could be given proper weight &amp; evaluated reasonably. For the longest time, I couldn't distinguish the parts of my conflicting "single" feeling. I was surprised by how intertwined they were.

						p38 talked more about p63 &amp; some other things, but I said the most important things.

					<section>
						Today, p63 was back, &amp; we could talk at lunch again (we only have lunch together on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays). After lunch was about half over, some somewhat obnoxious people came to sit at my end of the row of tables as they do every once in a while because it's pretty empty around me, &amp; they're "scared" of a few girls at their table. Unlike p38, p63, &amp; me <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span>, they say whatever's on their mind.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">p38 wasn't there today, &amp; I don't expect her to make a habit of coming over.</aside>
						Not much time went by before I was asked if she was my girlfriend. I was too busy giving <span class="p0">the asker</span> my stare of death, so I didn't see p63's reaction, but in my opinion, there was a considerable pause before she said we were just friends.
					</section>
					<section>
						Sometimes they would become preoccupied enough that p63 &amp; I could talk. She said how it's ridiculous how, any time she's seen talking to someone, her friends think they're dating. There were a few more things she said, but I couldn't believe how much what she was saying coincided with exactly what I would say. What she said was as close to literally word-for-word what I would say as humanly possible including the way she said it &amp; her facial expressions. It was uncanny. This is also one of the reasons I'm inclined to believe that she might be thinking the same thing about us as I am because I would only say something like that if I felt awkward &amp; wanted to seem like it wasn't too big of a deal &amp; so talked a little about it because immediately changing the conversation would be suspicious, but I wouldn't talk about it too long because, for one thing, it would be too awkward, but also, talking about it too long would make it seem like it was completely out of the question, &amp; although it's too early to make a commitment like that, it might not be too horrible of an idea. (Did you get all of that?) Those people that say whatever they think of also confirmed for me that p63 doesn't have a boyfriend. On another note, before they came over, I wanted to be sure I wasn't depriving her of her other friends, so I asked, &amp; she told me in a reassuring way that I'm not.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						It's a time like this when I think about what p1 told me months ago. He said that I better not just run off with the first girl I meet. I asked him why he thought I would do that, &amp; he said that all kids (which can be anywhere from a baby to someone in their 20's) think they've found the love of their life in a way meant to say kids are dumb &amp; can't control their emotions, advice told to me many times by him. P1 always offers conflicting advice like that; not necessarily conflicting with itself (although sometimes) but conflicting with previous advice. Some examples of this &amp; other comments are that I should ask questions when I'm not sure but I should figure out what he wants me to do without asking; I'm too logical &amp; am like a robot but I'm dumb in many instances &amp; let my emotions get the best of me; I'm too quiet &amp; it's going to cause everyone to hate me &amp; I'll be alone forever but I can be such a lady's-man that I need tons of advice on how to treat girls while I'm with them. It's just ridiculous. Since I don't want to give any merit to ridiculous claims, it bugs me when there might be something that comes close to doing so. Apparently, I don't have enough problems, so now I have to worry about whether I'm getting carried away. I actually don't quite think so, but there's plenty of doubt.
					</section>
					<section class="t14 t22">
						Even though I now have a bunch of other things to worry about, I much prefer things the way they are now. I'm sick of being lonely. Now that I have p63 to talk to, I've noticed that it doesn't matter to me too much anymore when people don't end up talking to me. I still want them to, but it doesn't bother me. That just goes to show that all I needed was one, good person to talk to. A little extra information to go along with that is that I often see p63 standing off by herself. One time, I said how she reached out to me because I looked lonely, but she's alone a bunch of the time too. She said, when she talks to her friends, they tend to migrate away from her, but it's okay now that there's me. I really don't know why people tend to migrate away from her so often.

					<section class="t14 t22">
						I'm not dumb enough to be oblivious to what this entry in my journal / autobiography suggests (if you call it a diary, you may find yourself being thrown out of a window), but aside from the ridiculousness, I'm very, very happy to not be so alone anymore, &amp; if nothing else, I think p63 &amp; I make really good friends.

						I've planned, since probably the conception of this journal, to give the notebooks this was originally written in (as in before this got published which is probably before you are reading this) to whoever I decided I'd try to make my girlfriend because it's easier for me to write about my feelings regarding that than to talk about them &amp; because it would talk about my life which would tell her what she's getting into. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2016?">Side note</span>

						In seemingly unrelated news, although any romantic <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span> thoughts &amp; therefore actions are omnipotently oppressed due to my intense feeling of awkwardness, I've always thought I'd try to force myself to dig up at least some of it for Valentine's Day.

						I wondered if I would do the same thing for an anniversary, &amp; it's not out of the question, but I figured an easy way to not worry about that was to take steps to cause the anniversary to be on Valentine's Day ("anniversary" can also count as a dating anniversary). Besides, it would be more romantic that way. However, I didn't know if I would prefer to get myself to indirectly ask someone out <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/21">(using my journal)</span> on a Friday or on Valentine's Day.

						Today, I was once again thinking about p63 &amp; started to go down a hypothetical path related to these previously mentioned ponderings. I began to wonder what day of the week Valentine's Day is going to be on this year to know how something like that might play out &amp; compare it to a scenario on a Friday in case I might one day work up the nerve, when it's far too obvious to ignore, to maybe use that information. Eventually, it bugged me enough to look in my school planner to figure it out. ... Valentine's Day is on a Friday. ...

					<section>
						When I found that out I nearly passed out. My parents weren't home yet, &amp; since I now had tons of nervous energy, I paced back &amp; forth (which I pretty much never do) for an easy 20 minutes. <span class="h-o3">There must be a foot deep trench going through the middle of the living room by now.</span> For the longest time, I couldn't even sit down to write this. If Valentine's Day was on <em>any</em> other day of the week, it would be something to just idly consider. If it was in a week or two, it would be too soon, &amp; I would put it off. But it's not; it's Valentine's Day, <em>and</em> it's a Friday, <em>and</em> it's a few months away. If just one of those things weren't true, it wouldn't get too serious, but they're all true, &amp; ... I might actually follow through.

						It scares me to put a specific time on something so awkward, but I do like her. It still amazes me how well we get along. When I'm around her, I can feel happiness radiating from her, &amp; it wouldn't take much convincing to make me believe that's what people feel coming off of me. I feel like I did when p38 "joked" about me flirting with p63: unbearably awkward with severely impaired concentration. However, I don't think you need reminding that that ended with me reluctantly accepting it as truth.

						Today is Veteran's Day. Like what is always done, we had an assembly to honor all veterans. There were speeches &amp; the band played. One thing that particularly stood out for me though was reading my essay for everyone.
					</section>
					<section>
						At some point last year, p41 (p41.pronunciation.lastName), the now retired after 30-something years Odyssey teacher, had us write an Americanism essay which was then entered into a contest. For some reason, it takes a ridiculous amount of time for the contest people to grade the essays, so I didn't find out how I did until a few months ago; I got first in the state &amp; maybe one day they'll tell me how I did on the national level. <span class="reflection" data-date="2024/3/23">Who knows how I did at the national level, assuming the contest even went beyond the state.</span>

						Because I did so well, p56.extra1 wanted me to come to a school board meeting to be recognized. While I was there, I was asked to read my essay. I could have declined <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/23">(I was given the option of someone else reading it)</span>, &amp; it wouldn't have surprised too many people because of how quiet I am, but I always think it's better when people read their own stuff, &amp; I knew everyone would think so too. I'm good at making my voice not sound nervous despite every single other fiber in my entire body being absolutely petrified. I think I read it quite well. Be glad I'm not p1 who reads in the most monotone voice you've ever heard &amp; never stops reading once he starts even when we (p2.extra1 &amp; I) ask him to because we're no longer paying attention.

						The essay was about voting, how good it is, &amp; how we shouldn't squander it. Its title was "Voting for the Future". I may or may not put the essay at the end of this entry when it comes time to publish this, but I'm too lazy to write it all down now. My favorite part is at the very end where it says, "The future is in our hands, and the last thing we should do with it is clench our fists." I didn't remember what my essay said before reading it because it had been something like half of a year, so I was happily surprised. <span class="h3">I always do what I can to not brag except where I'm obviously joking</span>, so I'm not going to emphasize how good that sentence or the rest of my essay was.
					</section>
					<section class="t18 t23">
						While I'm on that subject, there are plenty of times when I feel like this entire journal is a huge brag itself especially when I bring up this getting published in the future. It seems to me that you would have to have an extremely big head to be so confident in becoming famous that you would start writing an autobiography before hardly anyone cared about you at all. Because of that, I barely started writing this journal, &amp; I think the main reason I started to &amp; continue to write in this is because I want to get out my thoughts, &amp; I don't get many opportunities for that (I know that sounds like a diary, but you're still going to get thrown out of a window if you call it that). Also, there are many things I don't feel comfortable talking about but am willing to write down when no one's around to read it. I hope that you don't think I'm bragging, &amp; if you do, just know that it's not meant that way, &amp; I hope you don't think too badly of me because of it.

						Back to the main subject of this entry, I think me reading my essay at the board meeting which was put in the newspaper a few days later was the main reason p56 asked me to read it for the Veteran's Day assembly; he knew I might be willing, so he thought he'd try. When the day came (today), I dressed nice &amp; got prepared. On the way to the band room to get our stuff to play for the assembly, I told p63 how she better not laugh at me if I pass out in front of everyone. She said how she was sorry for me &amp; would probably cry if I passed out. Thankfully, I didn't have to see p63 cry.

						Reading my essay went about like it did at the board meeting: a good reading voice with an otherwise paralyzed body. When I'm about to speak in front of a bunch of people, I always think I'm going to sound bad, but I somehow manage to sound okay. I try to convince myself that talking to a bunch of people is no different from talking to just one person, &amp; if it doesn't scare me to talk to one person, it shouldn't scare me to talk to a bunch of people (which is true), but I can never quite get mself to believe it. I try to use reasoning like, if one person wouldn't judge me, why would a bunch of one persons do so, &amp; all I'm doing is reading a paper which uses next to no thought or concentration which would cause me to have many opportunities to mess up. It still doesn't work. Maybe if I talk in front of a bunch of people more often, I'll get over this ridiculous fear.

						After the usual proceedings of the Veteran's Day assembly, we went back to class. <del>On the way back, I learned p63's middle &amp; last names are p63.middleName &amp; p63.lastName because of her saying what her parents call her when they're angry with her.</del> <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2024/3/29">Explanation</span>

						When I got home p1 had things to say about my speech because he was there because he &amp; p2 (who had to work) were invited by p56.extra1 to listen to it. He started off good, saying how it was a good essay &amp; how I was brave to go up in front of all those people. However, far too early for my tastes, he started critiquing me as he does absolutely every single time I do anything he notices particularly in public. At least I made it through, &amp; plenty of people commended me for it which was nice.
