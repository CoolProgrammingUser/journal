				This will recount every important event in my life from birth to the first time I shared this journal with someone (in 10<sup>th</sup> grade). Keep in mind that, although I've added some things and tried to reformat others, this was originally written completely in notebooks with no expectation of it being put into a website (at least not any time soon). I also didn't bother with putting paragraph breaks anywhere for a long time, so I just made up wherever I thought was a good spot (which is pretty much what I do now anyway). In case you don't glance over the <a href="../indicators.html" target="_self">Indicators</a> page first (which you should) or you don't know how to interpret what I said, the things I've added at a time later than the date shown at the beginning of the entry are indicated with an <span class="afterthought">afterthought</span> styling, and <span class="elaborate">dotted underlines</span> and people's names are clickable.
				<aside data-heading="Seriously?">Did you really just click on that?</aside>
				Upon copying the content into this website, I tried to reword the introduction of my journal in the first entry since that was the one place I gave myself permission to make sure everything was relevant to my audience when it came time to publish (which I originally imagined to be in a book); however, as I got farther along in my copying efforts, I noticed the occasional reference back to the way the introduction was originally written, and I wasn't about to update every small reference to the way things were (assuming I'd be able to catch them all), and that level of revision bordered on rewriting my history anyway (since, for example, I may have decided to write about something I mentioned in the introduction because I forgot to do so elsewhere), so I brought back the original introduction. You'll probably find it interesting to read how I introduced my journal when I was 14, anyway. In case you're wondering (or will wonder), it's because of this type of problem that I also didn't cut and paste the events from my childhood into the correct order (since outlining first is for losers, and I didn't remember everything in order). I corrected the occasional spelling error (which I wouldn't have made in the first place if I had spellcheck or if English wasn't dumb), and I might've made a small revision if I thought something was unclear or hard-to-follow, but it's quite rare that I did anything at all (besides <span class="afterthought">add stuff</span>) because I didn't make many mistakes in the first place (in my opinion), and I wanted to keep as much of my original writing style in-tact as possible.

					<section>
						Hello, my name is Robert Tour Benson. I am writing this journal so that <span style="text-decoration:underline">when</span> I become famous for reasons you will soon see, people will know what happened to me leading up to it. Also, it will save me from needing to take forever writing an autobiography, &amp; I think the more casual &amp; conversational sort of tone will be more interesting than just boring facts. It's all true, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/me/Soon after my birth.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						First let me start by going over what has already happened. On March 11, 1998, I was born. I have red hair and freckles. I think my eyes look more bluish-green, but officially, they're blue. Also, just in case you see me in shorts &amp; notice something above the front of my right ankle &amp; wonder, "What happened?" Nothing happened. It's a red birthmark.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/My parents' wedding picture from 1995-7-1.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:14em">
						My parents are p1.firstName p1.middleName p1.lastName and p2.firstName p2.middleName p2.lastName. I don't really have any siblings, but I'll get to that later. For 8 years of my life I grew up at <span class="elaborate">5314 Highway N, St. Charles, Missouri</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							I was so specific with the address because I wanted it to be possible to track down the childhood home of the famous Robert Benson. I originally had the ZIP code written as well, but I erased it later because I thought it was excessive. (It doesn't even matter, anyway, because the city is more specific than the ZIP code in that part of the state.) This address rolled off my tongue very easily for many, many years because I had to recite it so frequently as a child, almost certainly so I could tell someone where I lived if I ever got lost.
						</aside>
						It was with a group of 4 other houses in a quickly commercializing area. I remember, when <span class="p0">some old people</span> died naturally, their house was turned into a restaurant called <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thyme-out-cafe-cottleville-2">Thyme Out</a>. When I was 3 I was sent to the <span class="elaborate">D.L.C.</span><aside data-heading="Acronym">Developmental Learning Center</aside> to learn where p2 worked. (It was a type of pre-school.) Besides a single scene of me in a crib with the baby-sitter nearby, my memories begin around this time.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="1">
						One memory is when <span class="p0">the jokester of the class</span> decided that he was really hungry and that the 2 hot dogs he had wasn't enough. Multiple times, he raised his hand and asked for another hot dog, and each time, when asked if he had had his second hot dog already (the maximum allowed), he would reply "no" and get another hot dog. <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious" data-date="2018/6/18">Explanation</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2018/6/18">
							Different people kept coming over to him, so he could keep the lie alive.
						</aside>
						I was shocked by how many times he was able to pull this off.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other major memory was when I first rode the bus, had a substitute bus driver, or both. There was <span class="p0">this girl</span> that was a few years older than me who also rode the bus and got off at the D.L.C. building with me. When we arrived, I got up and started to leave, but I noticed that she wasn't coming. She was talking to her friends, so I tried to get her attention, but it wasn't enough to get her attention mostly because I was too shy like I am now except now I'm a little less. I told the bus driver about it, but he didn't do much about it and eventually I got off the bus. A little while later the bus came back and dropped off the girl (I can't remember her name). She was upset, and she asked me why I didn't tell her to get off.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						Although there are bits and pieces of other memories from this time, one more I think might be of interest is one time when I was eating lunch with the class in <span class="elaborate">pre-K</span>. During this particular lunch, p2 happened to walk by, and when she did so, I enthusiastically greeted her with a "Hi <span class="person p2">Mommy</span>!" Immediately after doing so, the entire class including the teacher stared at me in silence for what felt like an eternity before going back to their business. It could've been that they were just staring at me for making a scene, but I was worried that they were thinking I was too old to be using a word like "Mommy", and I didn't want to take the chance, so from that point forward, I never referred to my parents as <span class="person p2">Mommy</span> or <span class="person p1">Daddy</span> again.
						<aside data-heading="Abbreviation">
							In case you couldn't figure it out, "pre-K" is short for "pre-Kindergarten" (although no one ever refered to it as that). It was the last of four stages that you went through as you grew up at the D.L.C..
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						While I'm listing other largely insignificant memories, I'll tell you that there was another when I was younger, and I needed to use the bathroom, but before I could make it all the way to the door, a teacher grabbed me and changed my (dry) diaper. Since it didn't seem like I would be allowed to use the bathroom while I was there, from that point forward, I would only go to the bathroom before or after being at the D.L.C..
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, in 2005 (when I was going into 2<sup>nd</sup> grade) my mom started working at <a href="https://warren.fhsdschools.org/">Warren Elementary</a> (my elementary school), so I stopped being dropped off at the D.L.C. from the bus and started being driven to school. Just in case you're wondering, p1 worked at National Vendors <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(a vending machine manufacturer)</span> but it didn't affect my life much so there's no point in writing about it. Throughout elementary school there was a pretty good amount of things of importance that happened.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing that happened is I learned to hate M.A.P. testing (Missouri Assessment Program), and wish I lived in Nebraska (<span class="elaborate">Nebraska Assessment Program</span>).
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							In case you don't get it, the joke is that, in Nebraska, I would be tested on napping.

					</section>
					<section id="iceCreamOreoCakeStory" data-coolness="2">
						Another thing that <span class="h3">I think is important</span> is that I learned my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher p3's Ice Cream Oreo Cake recipe! <span class="afterthought elaborate" data-date="2023/1/9">(It was a whole ordeal.)</span>
						<aside class="afterthought t1" data-heading="Ordeal" data-date="2023/1/9">
							As an end of the year reward, p3 was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, p3 made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked p3 for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, p3 tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since p2 was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with p3 about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, p3 kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to p3 one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.
						</aside>
						Since it's so amazing, I'll put the recipe in <span class="elaborate">here</span> so it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
						<aside class="t2" data-heading="Recipe">
							<ol>
								<li>Crush up Oreos, and put them at the bottom of the container you want.</li>
								<li>Melt some butter and pour it on the Oreo crumbs to make sure the bottom is stiff.</li>
								<li>Melt some ice cream a little and put it on.</li>
								<li>Freeze it all.</li>
								<li>Put on a layer of fudge (we're wimpy and use chocolate syrup) and a layer of whipped cream.</li>
								<li>Crush up some more Oreos and sprinkle them on top.</li>

								Now I may have forgotten one or two small steps, but if you do only what I said, you'll be fine.

						Back to what I was saying earlier, something else that is <span class="h1">super important</span> from elementary school was when, in 5<sup>th</sup> grade, we learned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJJmQojcLM">pi song</a> (yes pi).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something that actually was important is a collection of things that happened. I know this may sound cocky, but, throughout most of elementary school, I believe I was maturing more to a middle school level (see where if sounds cocky) but not with only good qualities. I was beginning to act like early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> graders would act in school which isn't the most pleasant. Luckily for me, this happened before everyone actually was in early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, so it wasn't accepted. I think that, if people would have accepted the things I did like they would have in 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I wouldn't be nearly as well-mannered (I'm not saying I'm completely well-mannered) as I would have been, and my life could have turned out a lot differently. Sometimes I wonder if I just got really lucky having this happen to me, &amp; other times, I think it would have been inevitable. The world may never know.
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Another impact on my life was my Spectra (class for gifted students) teacher, p4. I was always pretty shy and didn't want to make myself too noticeable, but p4 made sure that changed. She would always force us to act in skits and try to participate in discussions. VERY slowly, I came out of my shell. I'm not saying I'm the most out-going person now, but I'm a lot more than I was (which still isn't much). Something good, though, is that, now, I can choose to be out-going, but don't expect me to do so without a good, specific reason. I'm a pretty (amount not attribute) reserved &amp; mild person.

						<section>
							A final important event from my elementary school career was when I slept over at my friend p5's house for his birthday party. Before we went to bed there, we had cake and presents and did a few other things. When night came and everyone went to bed, not everyone could fall asleep immediately; I was one of those people. For a long time I couldn't fall asleep, and during that time, I heard a bunch of strange noises. It sounded like <span class="person p6 noindex">someone</span> got out of their sleeping bag, went down the steps, after a while caused a popping or hitting noise, then ran up the stairs and started breathing heavy. Soon afterwards, the person went back in their sleeping bag which was followed by what sounded like <span class="person p7 noindex">someone else</span> getting out of theirs for a short time and then getting back in. In the morning, everyone was awake and gathered around a small table having a discussion. I must not have missed much because nothing referred back to something I didn't hear. When I began listening, my friend, p6, started talking about that night.
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="person p6">He</span> said that he thought he heard a noise come from the basement so he went to check it out. Once he got there, he says he picked up the duct tape bat (yes, duct tape bat. It was pretty fat) and headed towards what he thought made the sound. Suddenly, the thing rushed out and he hit it with the bat. In the process, though, he says it scratched him. At this time he showed us what, if you looked REALLY hard and used your imagination a little, might look like a scratch. I couldn't tell what everyone else was thinking, but what I was thinking was that you could hardly even pass that off as a scratch, but you want us to believe that you got that from some strange, alien thing and that, just yesterday night (he told us this also), it was bleeding and somehow it magically healed to become this nearly non-existent, miniscule mark that you hold before us today. I didn't say anything about it because no one else was, and it didn't seem like he was lying about the rest of his story. He said that after that, he ran up the steps with it in pursuit (he might have said he knocked it back a few times or something) and then slammed and locked the door to where we were all sleeping. After that, he went back in his sleeping bag. Since we were all curious, he drew us a picture of the "alien". It looked small, had a big head, slits for a nose, and was gray.
						</section>
						<section>
							But that wasn't an end to the story-telling. When we were finished looking at the picture, p7 started saying what happened to him that same night. He said that he was awakened by the sound of p6 slamming the door and got up to see what was going on. He says that he looked out the window in the room and saw something really strange. Supposedly he saw a light post, (there wasn't one) a flying saucer above it, and a bunch of aliens on the ground. I can't remember his exact description of the aliens, I'm pretty sure they had red eyes or something was red, but I remember the distinct impression that p7's aliens and p6's alien descriptions didn't quite match. Despite the discrepancies, they didn't seem like they were lying, and I find it hard to believe, since their stories matched up with what I heard, that they would get up in the middle of the night and act it all out for anyone who might be listening with their eyes closed because they couldn't get to sleep. I'm not saying they couldn't have exaggerated a little something they saw into something ridiculous though. I'm sure you can see where this is going, but too bad! You're just going to have to suffer through it.
						</section>
						<section>
							After all of that, I think we stocked up on fake guns and then went on an all out alien hunt! As time went on, more and more people said they saw an alien. I think, somewhere along the line, p5 (whose sleepover it was) said that he thought aliens had come by before (not necessarily in his house). We also came up with color codes (like "code red" or "code blue") for what type of alien encounter we had so everyone could come and see for themselves. It never worked out which made sense to me because if you're yelling anything the alien is going to run away. So this went on for a long time and eventually everyone wanted to go inside to get a drink and "reload". I didn't really need to do all of that, so I stayed outside along with my friend, p8. As I was waiting, I wandered down the hill (p5's house was on a medium one), and p8 followed. When I looked around, I saw something that caught my eye: it was moving at a slow jog, was white, not much taller than me (now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I was 7, so I wasn't too tall), its head was blocked by the neighbor's deck, it was skinny, and had five fingers and three toes. It seemed that it was coming from the woods to the far side of the neighbor's house, so I rushed over there with surprising speed only to find that it was gone.
						</section>
						<section class="t4">
							I know what you're thinking, "This dude is crazy. Why should I listen to anything else he has to say?" but don't discredit everything else because of this one thing. I promise you this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. I'm not going to lie to you. As I was writing this memory I was thinking, "Gee, this sounds exactly like some fictional story that I'm making up," but I'm telling you it's not! You may say, "That was some guy in a costume," or "You must have remembered it wrong," or "You're just insane!" and you may be right (except for the last one), but I don't think so. One thing I hope you don't say though is that I actually am making this up to sound more interesting because <span class="h3">I don't lie</span>. I can only imagine what you're thinking now, "This guy really is crazy! First he says he saw an alien then he says he doesn't lie! What next!" You can think whatever you want, but if you went up to anyone that knows me well, they could tell you that I don't lie and, for that matter, that I don't say bad words either which is sadly becoming increasingly common for everyone around me. Really, if you asked someone that knows me well if I lie (since I've had this come up before), they would say something like, "Well... ya. I remember when he said..." and if I was around I would say, "I didn't say that I said..." then they would say, "Oh ya. That's right." If they didn't say all of that they would say, "Ya." If I asked them to come up with one time that I did they would say, "... um ... I don't know, but there's no way that you've never lied," probably what you're thinking, but they can't deny that I'm honest and don't say bad words without them lying themselves. <span class="t5">A good example is this: not too long ago I came up with this funny thing where I would take something of someone's and hide it under their chair. When they realized it was gone (which it was more funny if I gave it back to them before they realized it was missing), they would say something like, "Did you steal my ____?" and I would say, "I don't have your ____." Notice I'm not lying because I really don't have their whatever. Besides, I don't really think it's stealing, it's more like misplacing. If they were to say, "Did you misplace my ____?" I would say, "Why is it that you just naturally assume that I did something with your ____?" I won't answer the question directly because I won't directly lie about my answer.</span> Staying true to the not lying streak though, there are a VERY VERY VERY VERY few times (notice how many "very"s there are) where it might depend on what your definition of lying is. I know what you're thinking, "Ha! I finally got him!" but no. It was only like twice, and, once again, it just <span style="text-decoration:underline">might depend on what your definition of lying is</span>. You can take that however you like, but, either way, I think it's pretty good that, out of 14 years, there are only 2 times that lying is in question. Also, I need the denial. If I ever accepted it, I would feel absolutely horrible about myself. I already feel bad enough about myself as it is. The point is that I don't lie to people, &amp; you can count on that. I would appreciate it if people didn't bring it up because it's meaningless, &amp; I would rather not think about it.
						</section>
						<section>
							Anyway, back to the story that I'm NOT lying about. When everyone came back outside, I told them about what happened and it seemed like they believed me with the same intensity that I believed their "sightings" ("I'm not too sure I believe you, and who really cares anyway if it didn't happen to me"). Although we kept searching after that, I'm pretty sure no one saw anything else, and the enthusiasm was lost. Soon, parents started coming to pick their kids up, and, eventually, I had to go home as well. The worst part of this is that, a few years later, I finally got a straight answer from p8 (who was with me when I saw the thing) about if he remembered it. He said no. I can only assume it's the same with everyone else at the sleepover. That <em class="elaborate">really</em> stinks because, if there's a bunch of people who say the same thing happened, you might believe them. If there's only one person who says something happened, you're probably going to think they're crazy. I probably shouldn't blame you; it's easy to understand why you would think I'm crazy, but I promise you, like I said earlier, this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. Don't discredit everything else I say because of this.

								This is the first time I specifically indicate italics in my journal (by using a <span style="text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-style:wavy">squiggly underline</span> in the notebook since actually writing in italics is too difficult), and I can see that the word was originally capitalized but then erased and replaced with the italic version. I don't specifically remember the thought process anymore, but I'm almost certain that I was dissatisfied with using capitalization to indicate emphasis because I've always thought of it as being too strong of an indicator, so when I started needing to use it repeatedly due to the limitations of how distinct I could make my handwriting look, I got fed up with it and decided to come up with a way of implementing my own variety of italics. Although I did use to use capitalization for emphasis more frequently earlier in my life, based on my memory and the almost complete lack of emphasizing capitalization from this point forward, I'd say that I had largely progressed past that point by this time, and it's pretty much a guarantee that a significant amount of the capitalization writen prior to this point would've been written as italic instead if I had (presumably) settled on the method of indication earlier. However, I don't want to assume that I know what would've been italicized and what would've remained capitalized, so I've left the text as-written.

							In case you're wondering what I think of my alien encounter 10 and a half years later, I'll tell you that I definitely saw what I saw, but what exactly it was is anyone's guess. I've never been prone to drawing very unreasonable conclusions from my experiences, so when it comes to the idea that I was just a cute 7-year-old kid who let their imagination run away with them (which was obviously the opinion of my parents at the time), I throw that out right away. Although I still remember the incident (although not in nearly as much detail as this entry describes), I know better than to think my remaining memories are anything but what I've rehearsed in my head for years, so I can't go back to the original memory and try to extract any additional information while having the benefit of 17 additional years of experience. I'm not going to dismiss the idea that there's a totally reasonable explanation for what I saw, but my vision has worked just fine all my life, and I've never had a problem distinguishing an animal or person jogging up a hill from something more unusual; that was definitely something more unusual. That being said, had I witnessed this outside of the context of an alien hunt, I may have still thought it was strange and wondered about it for a little while, but I'm rather doubtful that I would've come to the conclusion that it was an alien. When it comes to my overall opinion on the existence of aliens, I think the universe is way too big for there to not be a single intelligent life form anywhere else, and if that life form knew about us, I'm sure it would be interested to learn more. Whether or not we've been visited by extraterrestrials is more debatable, and it's not uncommon that I think the accounts of alien encounters I hear about are just adults letting <em>their</em> imagination run away with them, but if the aliens had the technology to visit us, I wouldn't be particularly surprised to find out that they did. Wouldn't it be interesting if, at some point in the future, we made contact with an alien civilization which said that it did indeed visit us in secret in the past, and upon inspection of their logs, it was discovered that they stopped by Missouri 17 years ago and had a hard time completing their objectives because they were busy dodging a bunch of kids. Until such a time, however, I don't think we're going to get any closer to settling the dispute over exactly what I saw.

					<section id="jumpRopeForHeartStory" data-coolness="3">
						I can't believe I forgot about one of the best days in my life. Every year, the school would have a day of doing active activities such as jump roping, hula hooping (I can't remember for sure), and tug-of-war. One of the main events was the Jump Rope For Heart (which the day might have also been called). At that time, everyone who wanted to participate would get a jump rope and see who could jump the longest (maybe this wasn't a whole day thing because I'm pretty sure only one grade was in the gym at a time). In third grade I was doing great. People tripped up one by one until only me and one other person (p9) were left. After this went on for a while, slowly, people started cheering my name! The next thing I know, all of third grade is cheering for me! I actually feel bad for p9; it would really stink if I was jumping and everyone started cheering my competitor's name, but it's not like I wish it didn't happen. A while later, p9 finally slipped up and I was the champion! I didn't stop there though. The previous record was 14 minutes and something and I made <span class="elaborate">the record</span> 16 minutes and something! I went on so long that they made me move so they could start tug-of-war. Much later though, I was criticized for jumping too slow which I was jumping pretty slow, but I never had a chance to redeem myself because that was the last year they did the traditional Jump Rope For Heart. On a side note, I wish I could remember the seconds of my record &amp; the previous one like I did for a long time.
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/1/14" data-heading="Explanation">
							I was purposefully vague with "the record" here because I wasn't sure exactly which record I broke: After I set "the record", the teacher(s) made a point of telling me that I set the district record rather than just the school record, but I could never believe that a third grader could out-jump a high schooler, so I always felt like I missed something. I tossed around the idea that I might've broken the record for all elementary schools in the district or something, but I never got any clarification.

						When it was time for me to go to middle school, I went to the school district closer to where we lived. If you're paying attention, you'll have noticed that I'm referring to the house in the past tense, but I'm not there yet.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, so starts my middle school years.
					</section>
					<section>
						For one thing, I had to get up an hour earlier than I was used to (&asymp;7:00am) which was torture. The first day on the bus was weird because I hadn't riden a bus except for field trips for years because p2 drove me to school. I want to say it was like a dream, but that's corny &amp; there's probably a better way to describe it that I just can't think of. The point is, it felt strange.
					</section>
					<section class="t6">
						A strong theme throughout middle school is excessive time being spent on homework. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the time I spent doing homework wasn't lengthened by me at all, but, based on how much homework &amp; free time I have in high school, a large portion of it was the school's fault. It was miserable. Long breaks &amp; sometimes weekends were pretty much the only times I could escape homework's grip. I think that, somewhat because of this, I have problems with medium amounts of homework because I have all sorts of practice with tons of homework, &amp; anyone can deal with small amounts of homework, but I don't know how to budget my time for medium amounts of homework. I'm not using it as an excuse not to try, but I'd rather not have this problem (but it's better than dealing with the problem of too much homework).
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						Luckily, there are many good things that happened in middle school. Something I enjoyed was joining band. We would perform at places (usually the high school), &amp; it was fun. I played the trumpet, but next year we could switch to the french horn which I did. I can almost guarantee that I still have my trumpet by the time you read this (assuming I'm still alive) because we had to buy it &amp; I see no reason to get rid of it (the french horns are school instruments).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something I thought about early in middle school is how no one stands in lines to go anywhere. At first I thought it was kind-of rude, but really, what else are you going to do? <span class="elaborate obvious afterthought" data-date="2023/2/5">Elaboration</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/2/5" data-heading="Elaboration">
							During elementary school, the absence of a line while the class was going through the hallways was evidence of kids misbehaving and dispersing the line that should exist. However, in middle school, no one stays with the same people anymore, so you have to disperse in order to go to your separate classes.
						</aside>
						<span class="afterthought">I thought it was crazy how quickly everyone adjusted to middle school procedures, though: Even in the very first class on the very first day, the moment the bell rang, everyone instantly got up and piled through the door. In the meantime, I was still at my seat waiting for the teacher to finish their train of thought and then tell us it was time to get into a line to go.</span> Eventually I got over it.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/14">
						Another interesting change I noticed going into middle school was the attitude towards girls. Throughout all of my life leading up to middle school, everyone was in agreement that girls had cooties (or were gross or lame or whatever, "cooties" wasn't actually used much), but abruptly after middle school, you were suddenly immature if you thought girls had cooties. I never really understood why girls were supposed to have cooties in the first place because they seemed to be just like everyone else <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>, but with classmates and adults alike frequently referencing it, I figured I'd just go along with it.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="none">
							I did think girls were kind-of lame, but that was primarily because they generally didn't like videogames or play outside; I didn't think there was an inherent quality of girls which made them undesirable. Furthermore, I recognized that there was a good chance that girls were being lame because they felt like they <em>shouldn't</em> like videogames or play outside because that stuff isn't lady-like (much like how I felt like I shouldn't cry when I got hurt because that isn't manly). As society decreases the expectation that people fit into traditional gender roles (much like how videogames are definitely no longer thought of as being only for boys), it may be that there will be less reason for a young me to think that girls are lame at all, but this was the situation at the time.
						</aside>
						Since the idea girls had cooties, for me, was based on experienced expectations rather than my own opinion, I saw no reason to not continue making jokes about it in middle school, but when I saw that those jokes were almost universally failing, I decided that people had completely changed their minds on the topic in less than a year <span class="elaborate">for no apparent reason</span>, and so I adapted again to fit the expectations of those around me which now actually more closely aligned to my original thoughts.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="none">
							Okay, there was the obvious reason of people experiencing hormonal changes as they got older, but that was never a factor for me when determining who to make friends with <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>,
							<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Insistence" data-date="2023/6/17">
								I doubt many people at all believe that statement, but I stand by it. I won't discount a potential subtle influence in some situations, but my establishment of friends is based much more on who's around and what personality they have, especially in middle school. If you were to point out the lack of female friends in elementary school, I would attribute it to the social expectations (which aren't based on hormones, or at least mine), and I would furthermore point out how I actually did have a few female friends in Spectra where we were all forced to work together and ignore who may or may not have cooties. Much later, I actually go to great lengths to determine what may be influencing my friendships with boys and girls.
							</aside>
							so I didn't understand why it was for anyone else, and even with that reason in mind, it still didn't explain the stark contrast between elementary school and middle school. Not everyone is going to experience hormonal changes at the same time, so the change should be gradual if that was the only influence. It could be that the idea of the next level of schooling made people feel like they should establish a more mature outlook on the world, but <span class="elaborate">random life events without direct relevance</span> have never changed my opinions or personality, so I don't understand why they would for other people. It didn't make any sense then, and it doesn't make any sense now, but whatever.
							<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/6/18">
								Some people may consider going into middle school to be more than just a random life event without direct relevance, but even when taking into account the fact that it was a different school district, that's all I felt like it was. For me, in order to instill a sense that I need to become more mature for instance (which would never happen because I was always the mature one in my grade), I would need people to express an expectation that I should be more mature or I would need to observe that my current maturity level isn't allowing me to be as successful in life as I'd like to be. Both of those things are directly related to the behavior of interest whereas going up one more grade level in school yet again seems loosely associated at best. If the things I mentioned came along with moving up a grade level for whatever reason, it may be that I do change in that next year, but it would be because of those things and not because of the routine and independent occurrence of reaching a higher academic level. Aside from what I already mentioned, my opinions and personality were largely unchanged between elementary school and middle school.
							</aside>
						</aside>
						Because of this change in myself and the newly dissolved social barrier between boys and girls, the likelihood of me becoming friends with girls was greatly increased (although I still felt kind-of awkward about it for a long time).

						Not much happened in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, but in 7<sup>th</sup> grade there was (&amp; maybe still is) this thing called Medieval Day. People would come to school in medieval costumes &amp; then the whole day we did awesome stuff in the large gym. Earlier, we signed up for events to participate in. Throughout the day, we would do these events, &amp; you could really get into it. To help you understand who was versing each other &amp; who won, I need to say this: each grade level was divided into four "teams" (I guess to help order classes or something). Only 7<sup>th</sup> grade had Medieval Day so there were 4 teams competing. The teams of the school were named by the grade number dash either 1, 2, 3, or 4. I was in 7-4 (in the other 2 years I was in 6-4 &amp; 8-2). On Medieval Day, there was one team, either 7-1 or 7-2, that was losing by a long shot. It was funny though; once they figured they had absolutely no chance of winning, they started cheering really enthusiastically. You wouldn't have known they were losing if you weren't keeping track of the score. I think anyone else would've done the same; if you're going to lose, lose by a lot. The other teams, though, did not lose by a lot. In the end, it came down to the last event to determine 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup>. I think it was called "peasant plow". One person would be on this circular rolly thing while another person would hold on to their shoulders &amp; push them. They would go a certain distance, around a cone, then come back. It was like a relay. There was probably more to the rules than that, but that's the main idea. For the first few times back &amp; forth, no one could tell who was going to win. In the last time, though, my team pulled ahead &amp; we won! Whoo hoo!
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/2/5">
						I have a really good memory, but not everything sticks with me for a ridiculously long time, and some of these memories in particular are getting quite old. With the exception of one moment of us rattling the building with our screams during the final event (most likely), I didn't really remember Medieval Day at all. As I was typing up what I had written down, I was surprised to discover that the day existed at all, and although I didn't think we lost, I really had no idea what was going to happen. This is the kind of stuff you can't get from an autobiography. No recollection of my entire life after I become rich and famous is going to have much, if any, of these entertaining little glimpses into my life, especially my early life, and even important moments are likely to end up understated as I inevitably shift my priorities. Although it ends up leaving you with much more to read, I'm really happy I did things this way.
					</section>
					<section>
						There is another memory I have that's not really from 7<sup>th</sup> grade but involves someone from then. It's not that happy, but don't worry, happy memories are to come. <span class="person p12">My 7<sup>th</sup> grade math teacher</span> was awesome. My other teachers are usually pretty good too, but he was one of the better ones. Rather than handing stuff to us he would throw it to us &amp; hope we could catch. He liked to joke around &amp; was pretty nice. He was a volunteer firefighter &amp; told us all sorts of stories from his experiences. However, the summer after 8<sup>th</sup> grade, my opinion of him changed. I was told by p11.firstName &amp; others in my culd-e-sac that he was arrested. They said that he was found to be in possession of an inappropriate picture of a student. At first, I wasn't sure if I believed them; they tended to exaggerate things &amp; he seemed too nice for him to do something like that. Later, though, I heard something else about him on the news which made me believe. There was this thing that this school district did called 5<sup>th</sup> grade camp. For a week, all 5<sup>th</sup> graders would go to some camp site &amp; do stuff while learning. <span class="person p12">My teacher</span> was one of the people who helped there. At some point you must have to change for something because, apparently, my teacher offered to let everyone change in his room for more privacy &amp; then he video taped it secretly. It's hard for me to understand why he would do that. He was so nice, why ruin it?
					</section>
					<section>
						Now to those good memories I was talking about. In 8<sup>th</sup> grade there were a few fun things that happened.
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						One thing was when one of the 2 band teachers, p13, got teacher of the year. p14 (p14.pronunciation.lastName), the other band teacher, told us about it when she wasn't around. He gave a bunch of us a large letter, &amp; when p13 came back, p14 had us "show her the changes made to (whatever song it was)". I <em>really</em> wish someone was videotaping p13's reaction. When she first started conducting, she seemed like she was having a hard day. It might have been just me, but that's what it seemed like. When we started holding up the letters (one at a time), she looked confused. Once enough letters were up to tell what it said, p13's face got really red &amp; she started smiling &amp; laughing. I think the message was "CONGRATULATIONS p13.string.toUpperCase! TEACHER OF THE YEAR!" Afterwards, I think we all got cake.
					</section>
					<section class="t7" data-coolness="1">
						While on the subject of band, I remember something else that's funny. Although I really didn't see anything happen, just the thought of it makes me laugh. Apparently there was a rivalry between the band teachers &amp; someone in the office. From what I heard, the band teachers borrowed some scissors (which I don't get because I think they had some). When it was time to give them back, they put them in some Jello &amp; sent someone to give them back. Ever since that happened, I've wanted to do that. I can't remember for sure, but the person in the office might have given the band teachers something in Jello afterwards.

							Another prominent aspect of my time in middle school (and in general) is my development of codes. I always thought it was cool to have a secret writing system, so sometime in elementary school, I made my first code by adding things to the letters of English to obscure their original form. (I called this code <span data-revisit="check spelling">Adibri</span>.) That code served me for a time, but I was never satisfied with the degree to which I was able to hide the letters, and I was especially disappointed one day when p2 was able to largely read my encoded message despite never having been taught how to decode it. In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I decided it was time for an upgrade, and on October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I began putting together a more indecipherable code called Shayleig. I know the exact date because I could see when I started mapping letters to the symbols in my school planner. I may have finished creating the code by the 15<sup>th</sup>, but I'd have to check the planner again to be sure because I apparently didn't take good enough notes on what I saw, so I don't know what I meant by "lowercase, #ssuicid." on the 22<sup>nd</sup>. Like my old code, this code had symbols for both uppercase and lowercase letters (since it wouldn't be complete without it), but I roughly based the symbols off of the ends and intersections of lines in English letters, so it was much more difficult if not impossible to make a connection between the design of the symbol and what letter it corresponded to. Over time, I've made many more codes exploring different methods of encryption, but Shayleig was my go-to code. I slowly made improvements over the years, but this code was sufficiently cryptic that I used it heavily (most frequently in my planner or in the margins of school work when I had time), and I got great pleasure from doing so, especially when someone else couldn't figure out what I was saying. Since some people somehow think it's possible that I was so lame that I would need to reference a key to write my code, let me just clarify by saying that, except for a very short time at the beginning, I had Shayleig memorized, and to this day (June 8, 2023), I can still read it without a key. <span class="elaborate obvious">Extra information</span>
							<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/8" data-heading="Extra information">
								I have noticed my knowledge of the code slowly deteriorating because I can't type the code, and I've almost exclusively typed for years now, so it's getting a little harder for me to remember what the symbols are for the most recent revision of the code, but I can still get through reading it without a problem, and back in the day, I could read it almost as fast as normal letters and words.
							</aside>
						</section>
						<div class="t7 t8" id="originOfTheCode" data-coolness="2">
							<section>
								Naturally, a code is no fun if you can't confuse people with it, so it wasn't uncommon for me to write encrypted messages to people, and among those people were the band teachers. Band was always a less structured and more inviting class than my other classes, so I felt more empowered to do weird things. On or around December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2009, I used my go-to code Shayleig to write my first encoded message to the band teachers. ("It's amazing you accually solved this") You'll notice how I use the word "first" because that was far from the only encoded message I gave them. At fairly regular intervals, I would ask about their progress on deciphering the code, and whenever I decided they needed more incentive to figure it out, I would give them another encoded message. Sometimes, the reason I would give them another message would be because they would claim that they had deciphered my message(s), but based on how they refused to provide any proof of doing so (like saying what the message said), I figured they were just trying to get me to quit <span class="elaborate">nagging them</span>, so I would write a new message which they invariably couldn't read.
								<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
									Okay, let's just be clear here that, although I was persistent, I tried to make sure I didn't become a bother. There were some days when the band teachers didn't seem like they were having a good time, so I would let it go, and even when I was prompting them to work on my code, I put effort into making sure I didn't push so hard that it wasn't fun anymore. I may not have let them forget about my code, but to the best of my ability, I only did so in a way that didn't create a true irritation for them.
								</aside>
								This sort of thing would also happen when they claimed to have lost the message. (It may be that all additional messages had a specific reason to be written, and I just don't remember anymore.) The band teachers had no shortage of excuses about why they weren't getting anywhere, and despite my frequent prompting, this continued for quite a long time. Since those were the only two band teachers for the whole middle school (and I took band through all of middle school), I had them as my teachers for the next two years, and the saga of my encoded messages continued throughout that time. Somewhere along the line, I decided to occasionally write encoded messages on the white board before class as another means of keeping my code at the forefront of their minds (and perhaps also as a means of decreasing direct nagging), but it made little difference.
							</section>
							<section>
								Towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, though, there was a major development. Leading up to this time, p13 had started taking over as the one who seemed like they may actually solve my code one day, and with the end of my middle school career approaching, she was running out of time. Towards the end of the year, though, she claimed that she had figured out my code. Considering how I had heard this story before, I wasn't very keen to believe it, and naturally, she had "forgotten" the code stuff at home, so she couldn't provide proof; however, she did seem a little more insistant than during previous claims of success. Still doubtful, I proceeded to write an encoded message on the white board, and as I was writing it, p13 was correctly reading to me what I was writing. It may have taken 2.5 years, but she had actually deciphered my code. That wasn't the end of the story, though.
							</section>
							<section>
								<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/things/papers/The Code enhanced.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
								Having endured years of pestering about solving my code, p13 wasn't satisfied with just figuring out what my messages said; she needed to find a way to try to get back at me. As such, she made her own encoded message which she tasked me with deciphering. I vowed to conquer her code, but with the end of the year so near, there was other stuff going on and not much time for me to demonstrate my victory to her. I wasn't able to find a solution before I graduated from middle school, but I refused to be beaten, and I continued to work on it afterwards. What I inevitably discovered, though, was that there wasn't enough context for me to work with: When approaching the decryption of codes, it's typically helpful to use the frequency of appearance of certain symbols to guide your guesses of the correct letter. Moreover, you can use the placement of symbols within words (assuming the spaces are obvious) to help eliminate some potential options. With the code p13 provided, the spaces were obvious, but there were only 4 words. If you were to arbitrarily assign a unique letter to each unique symbol (besides the exclamation point and what's obviously a space), the message would be "abcde fgh ij kflme!" A frequency analysis with 4 words is completely meaningless, and there are very few opportunities to narrow down potential options based on symbol placement. To worsen the situation, it was possible that the first symbol was a capital with a different symbol from its lowercase equivalent since she may have wanted to provide me with the same level of difficulty as my own code. That isn't a problem if the letter isn't used elsewhere, but it becomes a significant problem if one of the other letters is the same as the first one. I spent a lot of time trying to systematically eliminate possible symbol decryptions, and I racked my brain for possible word combinations that would make sense in this context, but there are just too many words, so I couldn't go through every possiblity, and I couldn't narrow down what letters never appear in a certain place in a word very well at all. I could've gone through the dictionary and kept track of how every word might fit into the code, but that would've taken months if not years of intense work, and I still might not have been able to get the information that I needed. With seemingly insurmountable obstacles surrounding me on all sides, I reluctantly had to set the code aside... for a while, that is...

							In other code-related news, the band teachers weren't the only teachers I gave an encoded message to. Although it was much later and didn't become nearly as much of an ordeal, I also gave a message to my <span class="elaborate">G.A.T.E.</span> teacher, p15.<aside data-heading="Acronym">Gifted And Talented Education</aside> I don't remember the exact timeline anymore (although it may be hidden in my school planner), but this was towards the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and in about a week (definitely less than a month, maybe as little as a few days), she had deciphered my code, and what really got me was that she even pointed out a few spelling and grammar errors I made. Since this happened after p13 had solved my code, I made mention of how p15 would be doing better than the band teachers if she figured out my code in less than 3 years, and when she did, she questioned whether it really took the band teachers 3 years, but as you now know yourself, that was hardly an exaggeration.

						Another good 8<sup>th</sup> grade experience is something that happened in G.A.T.E. class (Gifted And Talented Education). It was getting towards the end of the year &amp; usually everyone in the 8<sup>th</sup> grade class would give something to the teacher, p15, before they left for high school. At first it was something like a picture with a little extra then it upgraded to a ceiling tile, one of the ceiling tiles even had gulible written on it so someone could really say, "gulible's written on the ceiling." Each year, the gift got better. That was no exception for us. One day I got a letter in school asking me to give $<span data-currency="USD">8</span> to get something for p15 (it said what it was going to be, but I want to surprise you).

						A last, significant memory of middle school is of the "8<sup>th</sup> grade outing". The 8<sup>th</sup> grade outing is pretty much a free day at the end of the year where we get to do fun stuff. For a good majority of the day, we just stood around outside with our yearbooks &amp; a few things from the gym to do stuff with. That's not the interesting part. One cool thing of the day was that we got pizza and Gatorade for lunch. Throughout the course of the day, before we all went inside, I was obviously talking &amp; walking with some friends of mine. Since the whole 8<sup>th</sup> grade was there, I got to see some of their friends. As I thought about these friends of friends, I began to think about my friends &amp; what they were like as well. It was that day I realized how much of an outsider I was (&amp; am). When I saw how strange they were &amp; was spurred into thinking back &amp; realizing how strange they were, it finally hit me that I'm more of an outsider than I thought. I don't mean strange in a necessarily bad way, but they were certainly contrasting to normal. I never really thought of myself as much of an outsider, just a more reserved person. It's not that big of a deal though. It's not like I'm treated much different from everyone else.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, back to the 8<sup>th</sup> grade outing. After a ridiculous amount of time sitting outside doing nothing, everyone started going inside &amp; I wanted to see what was going on. I think the 3 things that happened were in this order, but don't hold me to it.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="1">
						As I was walking in I heard some music. When I looked to see where it was coming from I saw Finally Friday playing it. It will be cool if they become some big-time band in the future, but I'll explain just in case. For each of the past talent shows a few people from my grade came together &amp; played music. It's the general concensus that they're good including my opinion. I guess because everyone liked them &amp; they didn't have to be paid, the teachers decided to have them play. There were at least 2 times that they finished playing, but were told they could play one more song. It was seriously like a rock concert in there except with less people.
					</section>
					<section>
						Next, there was an inspirational speaker who was funny.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="3">
						The last thing no one knew was going to happen. The <span class="person p16">8<sup>th</sup> grade principal</span> said that there was a special award to be given to someone. She said the person getting it was p17 (p17.pronunciation.lastName, as in ouch), my 8<sup>th</sup> grade math teacher. They still hadn't said what she had won when I heard screaming (like when a movie star walks into someplace). I looked to see what was going on, &amp; when the person came into my view, who do I see but p17's <span class="person p18">boyfriend</span> in a nice suit walking towards her. By then everyone knew what was going on, &amp; p17 looked like she was about to pass out &amp; explode with happiness at the same time. When her boyfriend got up there, he got down on 1 knee &amp; proposed. She could hardly say anything, but I saw her head nod. Right after that, I think he put the ring on (he must have, but I don't remember it specifically) &amp; then went to a microphone &amp; said, "Oh my gosh, she said yes!" There was all sorts of cheering. I guess she'll be Mrs. p17.marriedName soon.
					</section>
					<section>
						After all of that, we got slushies. It was an awesome day.
					</section>
					<section>
						I could tell you more about the people in middle school, but that would take forever. You can get your fill of drama (not that I'm in much) from high school.
					</section>
					<div class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/14">
						<section>
							Let's give it a shot, though. I'll give a brief overview:
						</section>
						<ul>
							<li>
								One of the first people I got to know was p19. He was a very calm person and was in band with me.
							</li>
							<li>
								p20 and p21 were frequently in my company, and they, especially, were the ones with the strange friends who helped me realize what an outsider I was. They (along with others as it became popular) would frequenly steal my lunch when we sat together at the lunch table (especially p21), but I knew they were just taking joking around too far, and I'd usually get it back, so I could mostly get over it. Once or twice, something of mine was taken and then either thrown away or eaten, and that didn't go over well with me at all, so that never became much of an issue. After a while, I started licking all of the stuff in my lunch bag so they wouldn't want to touch it, but in time, they stopped caring about that. Towards the end of middle school, though, through some combination of them getting bored with it and me getting fed up with it, the instances of lunch theft decreased.
							</li>
							<li>
								p22 p22.lastName was someone who I primarily saw at lunch (with p20 and p21 and others), and unlike the others, he was calm, thought about things more deeply, and didn't steal my lunch.
							</li>
							<li>
								p23 and p24 were two people in a lot of my classes (including G.A.T.E.), and they were pretty nice. p23 was quite calm whereas p24 had a lot of energy to expend. They had a rivalry between each other which was plainly started by p24, but p23 would play along, and they'd have fun. p24 was in band with me whereas p23 was a loser in orchestra (although percussion would often get shared with orchestra, so p24 was often in orchestra as well). Both of them played instruments in the band Finally Friday (p24 on drums and p23 on guitar), while the singer was someone I would see around but didn't really know (p25). p24 was the only person I knew to be in a relationship (not with p25) and seem to take it seriously. I was secretly jealous of p24 and p23 because they were in a (more) advanced math class which I felt more than capable of taking on, but because I had to rely on the slow rate of teaching to increase my math knowledge, I could never catch up to the higher grade level of math that they were at. (They were the only two people in my grade who were taking the math classes of the next grade up.) I always found it to be an interesting coincidence that p23 and p24 became rather close friends because they have very similar last names (p23.lastName and p24.lastName).
							</li>
							<li>
								p26 p26.lastName and p27 were basically the class clowns. They were very out-going and were quick to make a joke about anything. They thoroughly enjoyed being partners in crime, but they were generally good about making sure they didn't take things too far. p26 was in G.A.T.E. with me, but I don't think p27 was (although we did share the advanced math class). Something I found amusing that stuck with me was, a few times when one of their jokes would fall flat with the class, they would pick up the hand of the other person to high five it and pretend like that signified the support of at least one other person in the class.
							</li>
							<li>
								p28 rode my bus (and was in my grade) and was kind-of crazy. Some common topics that came up with him were butter toast, eating children, and Vietnam (he wasn't Asian). While in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, we both had the same <span class="person p29">science teacher</span> at different times of day, and he would complain about her all the time (often lightheartedly). One day, I spilled p28's secrets to the teacher, and later on, p28 told me a great story about how she called him out and embarassed him in class. Ah, memories. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span>
								<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
									Okay, I'm not a monster: The stuff he complained about wasn't all that serious, and the way he was embarassed wasn't the end of the world. <span class="h-o2">Although he was plainly traumatized from the experience,</span> he was smiling as he recounted the horror I put him through.
								</aside>
							</li>
							<li>
								p30, p31, and p32 were my fellow French horn players, so we would sit next to each other and talk about things frequently. I can't quite remember anymore, but I'm pretty sure that p31 was in G.A.T.E. and that it was him who coordinated the gift of the <span class="p15" data-use="lastName.string.toUpperCase"></span>INATOR sign. p32 thought it would be fun to call me a nickname, so she would occasionally refer to me as "Roberto", but she later decided that "Roberto" was too long, so she shortened it to "Bird Toe". In response, I would occasionally refer to her as something like "p32.extra1".
							</li>
							<li>
								p33 was fairly out-going, and she had this strange tendency to frequently tell me how I had long eyelashes. Later on, I found out that she would tell p19 that he had "beautiful eyebrows", and when I commented on that to her, she tried out saying that to me as well, but it never gained much traction.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<section>
						However, there's one thing I want to tell you that I think is interesting. When going from middle school to this high school, miles away from the previous school district, I've noticed a few people with personalities remarkably similar to people I knew. Also, some people look uncannily like other people I knew. It's weird.
					</section>
					<section>
						There are 2 main important things that happened at home during my middle school years, one of which led to a 3<sup>rd</sup>.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/Shawny holding me.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:12em">
						The first of these things explains when I said, "I don't really have any siblings, but I'll get into that later." This is later. I remember p1 saying a few times that I may have a sister. Now you're probably thinking, "What do you mean by that?" Well, years &amp; years ago, apparently p1 liked <span class="person p34">some girl</span> a little too much, &amp; later she had a baby under suspicious circumstances. P1 brought it up with her, but she wasn't very helpful, &amp; although he tried, p1 didn't have enough money to pursue it in depth. A few years ago, p1 somehow found someone on Facebook who was friends with p35.firstName p35.lastName, what he thought her name was (the kid). Eventually he got a hold of her &amp; it seemed like she was the right person. He waited until she was 18 (which was only a few months) <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/17">(This would put the events at happening in mid- to late-2008, so the end of grade school.)</span> &amp; had a DNA test done. He waited so he wouldn't have to pay back child support. We never really had or have much money, but we're not really poor; we just have to be careful with money. The test came out something like 99.98% positive, so I'd say p1 was right. We all met up soon after that in some restaurant. She brought <span class="p0">her uncle</span> along which is reasonable. At later times, we went (without her uncle) to various places.
					</section>
					<section class="t10">
						However, life couldn't be easy. Mostly through phone calls &amp; e-mail, things started taking a wrong turn. For one thing, p1 wanted to see her a whole lot, but I'm not sure if that would have been enough to run it bad. The main thing was how, apparently, p1 has been holding a grudge against <span class="person p34">her mom</span>. He was really upset that she made it so difficult to get to p35, &amp; he made sure to tell p35 that she was the reason he hadn't been around for all that time. I don't know about you, but if someone I didn't know very well just came up to me &amp; told me the parent I've lived with all my life was a horrible person, that wouldn't go over well with me very well. The same happened with her, but p1 thinks he has to bring it up to defend himself which makes sense, but if one thing doesn't work, TRY SOMETHING ELSE! He now has a grudge against her. It affects him a lot, &amp; you can tell it must go through his head a few times a day at least. One day, when I have my own house &amp; at least a small reason to go, I'll find p35 &amp; fix all of this. I don't think she has much of a problem with me. Until then, all I can do is hope things get better.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I look back at the beginning of this autobiography, I want to change "don't really have any siblings" to "have a half-sister", but I'm trying not to change much, so you can see how I progress as a person. The reason I would say that in the first place is because it's weird to just suddenly include someone in your family that you weren't even sure existed for about 11 years of your life &amp; then don't really see much of afterwards.
					</section>
					<section>
						The second thing that happened at home during middle school isn't very happy either.
					</section>
					<section>
						When we moved to the house we lived in at the time, we still had the old house to pay for because it hadn't been sold yet. That continued to drain our money until it finally sold. I think it was bought by the mayor &amp; was eventually turned into a wine &amp; cheese shop. At some point, I'm going to figure out what it's called. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(<a href="https://www.cottlevillewineseller.com/">The Cottleville Wine Seller.</a>)</span> After all of this, we needed to sell something else.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/places/Mom and me walking in the farm creek.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/people/me/First baby alpaca.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						We used to own a place in Winfield, Missouri, that was out in the woods &amp; was paid off. We called it The Farm, but don't get the wrong idea, <span class="elaborate">it wasn't a farm</span>.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Concession" data-date="2023/6/23">
							Okay, you could make an argument that it was a livestock farm for alpacas, but when I think of a farm, I think of large open areas for growing crops or for allowing the grazing of a large number of animals, not a primarily wooded area on a relatively steep hill home to a few domesticated animals. We were directly adjacent to a farm, but to me, this property was just a cool place in the woods that happened to have some alpacas on it.
						</aside>
						It doesn't make much sense why we called it that, but that's not the point. It had an open area, a stream, a huge hill through the woods open on top, &amp; a lake. I didn't like it getting sold, but I moved on. I can't remember exactly when we sold it, so there might have been other factors that went into selling it <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(such as the neighbor's dogs killing all of the alpacas)</span>. In the end, though, it didn't save us. The idea was, we were close to paying off the newer house, &amp; if we had a little more money, we could do it. P1 was told that the stock market had never been lower, so he should put his money in, &amp; he could make the money he wanted. If you know about this period in time, you can see where this is going <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/23">(although I wouldn't)</span>. P1 thought it was a pretty good idea, so he put it in. He wasn't experienced with it, but I don't think that would have mattered much. It just went downhill from there. The stock market didn't go back up after being low; it just went further down. This continued until we had pretty much nothing left. Real estate wasn't going well for p1, &amp; p2 didn't make enough money to support all of us.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/places/West Evergreen house.jpg" class="display-right" style="width:14em">
						This led to us needing to move. We looked all over the place, but all of the inexpensive houses weren't very appealing. We almost got one that wouldn't have been too bad &amp; would have been in the same school district, but that fell through. Eventually, we came across our current house at 2368 West Evergreen Drive, Pacific, Missouri. My first thought when I heard what city it was in was, "What genius names a city after an ocean?!" Anyway, the house is 2 stories &amp; is near the top of a large hill.
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/things/Awesome pine tree.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:10em">
						<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/places/View from pine tree.jpg" class="display-left" style="width:14em">
						There's a lot of woods behind the house, a huge pine tree in the front that literally seems to be made for climbing, neighbors a fairly short distance away, &amp; down the street, there's a huge lake. There are some drawbacks, though. There's no basement, mice, water damage, &amp; evidence to support termites being in one wall. The biggest problem, I'd say, is mold. We looked at this awhile before getting it, &amp; in the spring, you could really tell it was going to be an issue. You can't really see it very easily, &amp; it may be in only one room, but in the spring you could definitely smell it. It was <em>horrible</em>. I'm guessing over the summer it dried up, &amp; we somehow lucked out over the fall until it's too cold, but it's still there. Spring is only one season away, &amp; we need to make sure it's gone before it comes back to life. Just so you know, we moved here over the summer. We thought our old house would be foreclosed on, but at the very last second, someone bought it. We didn't get any money off of it, but our debts got paid. Also in case you're wondering, the house we bought was something around $<span data-currency="USD">20,000</span>. Where did we get the money? P2 has an aunt that had an inheritance for her. We persuaded her to give it to us early.
					</section>
					<section>
						And so ends the middle school portion of my life. The high school part has begun only recently, but I'll go more into detail.
					</section>
					<section>
						Over the summer, a little before school, the band has "Band Camp". It's not really a camp. Every morning, for 2 weeks, I had to get up ridiculously early (about 6:00am, which turns out to be about when I need to get up to get to school), &amp; get to the school band room. I found it the first time by following other people. At the beginning, we spent most of our time outside, behind the school, working on "the show" (the pictures to make on the football field) in the scorching heat. Later, we started working more inside on music. At the end of the 2 weeks, we performed it for our parents.
					</section>
					<section>
						Closer to the beginning of school, I had to be registered. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(Yes, I was killing myself in band before I was even officially registered to be a student there.)</span> I got to see where my classes were, so I wasn't so lost, &amp; I even got to pick my locker. P1 got frustrated that I took so long to pick my locker &amp; especially when I didn't pick what he thought would be best. I think my choice ended up being the best because I don't have to worry about people directly to my left or right, &amp; a big group of people gather right in front of where the other locker would have been.
					</section>
					<section class="t11">
						The first day of school was certainly interesting. For one thing, no one was at the bus stop, &amp; it was strange being in a completely different place. When I got nervous was when the bus stopped at a school that wasn't the high school. I started freaking out, but then I noticed not everyone got off. I didn't understand what was going on, but calmed down for the time being. That didn't last long. I got even more nervous than before when the bus stopped for a second time at a school that wasn't the high school. I looked around, &amp; still not everyone was getting off. I was <em>really</em> hoping everyone knew what they were doing. At the third &amp; final stop, we arrived at the high school. My blood pressure finally returned to normal, &amp; I got off the bus. It takes about 30 minutes to get to &amp; from school. The rest of the school day progressed just about the same as any other first one of the year. However, I ran into problems with the bus again. Since I had never riden that bus before, I didn't know what number it was. I went to the office to find out, &amp; they said it was number 9. When I went to get on, I noticed it was <span class="p0">a different bus driver</span>. When I brought it up, she said she was a substitute. After she saw I was still unsure, she asked where I lived. I told her West Evergreen, but I didn't really know any more of the address. She said she delivered to Evergreen, &amp; I thought, "How many Evergreens could there possibly be, &amp; besides, the office told me it was this bus." Apparently, there could be 3 Evergreens. I didn't really know the bus route, so I didn't realize I was on the wrong bus until we arrived at a big sign that said, "Evergreen" that wasn't where I lived. There was only one stop left, &amp; then the bus driver had me go to the front, &amp; I gave her a description of where I lived. I guess she had other places to go because she dropped me off at an elementary school <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">where I was met by <span class="person p36">one of the high school band teachers</span></span>, &amp; another bus came to take me home. It turns out I was supposed to ride bus 2. I still don't know why the office told me the wrong number.
					</section>
					<section>
						The bus ride was confusing &amp; inconsistent for a long time, but it eventually worked itself out. The bus stops at 3 places because there's apparently so few people that they all get piled into one bus &amp; still have a bunch of room left over. The first stop is a middle school for 6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> grade. The next stop is a school called Riverbend for 8<sup>th</sup> grade. The last stop is, like I said, the high school. On the way back home, it's in reverse. When I wondered what was going on with Riverbend &amp; why there wasn't a middle school with 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, &amp; 8<sup>th</sup> grade, I was told that Riverbend was newly built to accommodate an increasing amount of students, &amp; 2 school areas were arguing over who would get the new stuff. Eventually, they decided they both could have it by making the middle schools only 6<sup>th</sup> &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> grade &amp; having the 8<sup>th</sup> grade go there.
					</section>
					<section>
						Returning to my classes, something got messed up in my schedule during registration: Social Studies was left out. When I discovered this, I had to figure out which class I was going to replace. After much thought &amp; deliberation, I decided to take my one year of <span class="elaborate">P.E.</span> next year. <aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25" data-heading="Acronym">Physical Education. This is how it had always been refered to throughout my time in school.</aside> I have Band, Explorations, Science, Academic Advisory, Communication Arts, Spanish, Math, &amp; Social Studies. Academic Advisory is a class where everyone just gets to work on homework. It's awesome. Explorations is a class for gifted students. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">Explorations is the class I was strongly considering giving up insead of P.E. since that type of class had never seemed to provide much practical value to me, but I wanted to give it a shot, and I strongly suspected that I wouldn't make room for the class in future years.</span> On Mondays, we have all our classes except 4<sup>th</sup> hour (Academic Advisory). The classes are 47 minutes long. On Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays we have odd classes, &amp; on Wednesdays &amp; Fridays we have even classes. The classes are an hour &amp; a half. School starts off at 7:30 &amp; ends at 2:20. None of the clocks are synchronized, so it's useless to attempt to see if your're running late to a class or on time. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">There were also actual metal bells that rang between the classes rather than a tone broadcast over the intercom.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t11 t12">
						My first day in Explorations was weird. It's not like now it's any different; I've just gotten used to it. When I walked in &amp; sat down, I thought there couldn't be that few of people. Yes there could. After the bell rang, the grand total was 8, including myself, with no one missing. Another thing is that they're all girls (not including myself). I later found out that they're all Sophmores. Isn't that fun. Depending on what type of person you are, you could be thinking one of two things. You could be thinking either how lucky I am or, like me, how I'd much rather the class not be all girls. They're all <em>really</em> out-going people too. I don't feel the most comfortable in that class, but it's not like it's necessarily in a bad way. I'm just uncomfortable. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25">(I'm not made to feel like I don't belong or are otherwise subjected to a negative experience; it's just awkward.)</span> One person does a really good job of making me feel uncomfortable. She's p38. For one thing, she likes making unnecessary physical contact like patting me on the head or poking me. She's told me that she does it to other people, &amp; I believe her, but it's still weird. Another creepy thing is how she said her goal in life is to have red haired children. In case you weren't paying attention, I have red hair. Something I could have gone my whole life without knowing is when she said that every once in a while she watches me eat. I can't tell if she does anymore. The most creepy thing she's done is when she said something along the lines of, "I just love you. I love all the things you say &amp; all the stuff you do." To be fair, she went on to say how there are many types of love, but that didn't help much. The thing that gives me mostly peace of mind is how she has <span class="person p39">a boyfriend</span> that even has red hair. If you want to make me feel comfortable, don't say or do anything she's said or done.
					</section>
					<section class="t11 t12">
						She's not the only weird one from that class, though. For awhile now, 2 people have been coming to my Academic Advisory during the time you can travel from class to class &amp; have just stood in the doorway saying my name &amp; waving for about 30 seconds &amp; then leave. I don't know about you, but I find it hard to believe that almost every Academic Advisory (most people call it Ac lab), usually the same 2 people have to talk to some teacher on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, &amp; they just happen to pass my classroom &amp; feel the sudden urge to be weird. It makes me wonder what they tell their teacher.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/25">
						Since it's not likely clear from my phrasing, I'd like to mention how I didn't actually have any negative opinions of all these people being weird. I may be using words like "weird" and "uncomfortable" and "creepy", but those were just my attempts to describe a general feeling of awkwardness. I was actually flattered by the interest they showed in me, and they were quite friendly; it's just that they were also quite strange, and being the reserved person that I was, their extra-friendly behavior brought out my awkwardness even more frequently than it was usually brought out. Although there can be debate over exactly how clear it was, I think my responses to their behavior adequately demonstrated that, although I felt awkward, I wasn't bothered by what they were doing.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other classes are fine. As usual, they're all extremely easy.
					</section>
					<section>
						Something sort-of related to school is what I call myself. For my entire life, I had gone by <span class="elaborate">Robbie</span>.<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/25" data-heading="Extra information">Although half of my family thought I went by "Robby".</aside> When we moved, p1 said I needed to use a more grown-up name. He figured that we were at a place where no one knew me &amp; going from middle school to high school, so it would be a perfect time. I was already thinking the same thing but very well might not have done it if he didn't push me. He didn't have to push <em>that</em> hard, though. So now I'm Robert. It's an older name, &amp; I don't have to worry about whether to put my official name or not on something fairly official. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/25">I also just liked "Robert" better than "Rob", and I wanted a name that maintained some amount of distinction between p1 and me: P1 goes by p1.extra2, and it was enough of a headache having a p1.extra2 and a Robbie; there didn't need to be two Robs. P1, on the other hand, thought "Robert" sounded stuck-up, and he vehemently insisted that I use "Rob" instead. To this day 11 years later, he still introduces me as Rob.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						That pretty much catches you up to what's happening now. In case you didn't already figure it out, there is absolutely no way I wrote this whole entry in one day. It is now Christmas, &amp; I write this as I longingly stare at unopened presents. We have a family get-together every Christmas, so you can expect me to write about it tomorrow.

						Christmas was pretty good. The presents keep getting less interesting, but I realize we don't have much money, &amp; I was told I should figure out what I want. It's not like I don't want anything; I just can't think of everything at once. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">I would also never dwell much on what I wanted because I knew there was essentially no chance of us buying it, and allowing myself to imagine having it would just make me upset that I couldn't have it. However, with purging my mind of such thoughts, it also made it more difficult for me to think of what I wanted when given the opportunity.</span> We went to <span class="person p40">my aunt</span>'s house after a while. There were less people there than usual. We also did less than usual. I don't know what happened. We ate, &amp; later I got to open two extra presents. Everyone pretty much just talked the rest of the time, but we played a few, small games. There wasn't too much else that happened.

						I forgot two big things that happened in high school so far, so I guess I'll put it here. The first thing was all over the news. Some person in band was voted homecoming queen as a joke. It was said that people would humiliate her during the homecoming parade <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">(which I was in with the band)</span>, but everyone made sure that didn't happen. P1 was also interviewed about it for the news, &amp; we recorded it.
					</section>
					<section class="t11">
						Another thing was a bomb threat at the school. Apparently, someone spraypainted on one of the bathroom walls that they were going to blow up the school. We were all evacuated, but no bomb was found. We weren't allowed to go back to get our stuff, so I was locked outside the house for a few hours.

						Pacific doesn't strike me as a particularly inhospitable place, &amp; I don't think it used to be one either, but they could have gotten off on a better foot than that. What's even more sad is I think both of these things happened during the first quarter of school or close to it.

						It's been warm lately. This is the second time it's flurried this entire fall &amp; winter. Not even snow, just flurries. I don't think it snowed much last year either. The summer was really hot &amp; dry too. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/26">(I can't say for sure anymore, but I'm pretty much certain that the dryness only applied to the ground and rainfall, not the air which can still manage to be humid.)</span> They say food prices are going to go up a litte next year because of the smaller amount of crops that survived. We had a pretty consistant temperature of about 100 (Fahrenheit) for a long time. Now, it's hardly gotten below freezing every once in a while. It sure makes you want to believe in Global Warming. It's not like I haven't believed in Global Warming. I just haven't really seen any effects of it. I don't get why people are so against believing it. All they're doing is making it worse. The reason I believe is because I tend to believe calm, serious people rather than people frantically &amp; blindly searching for a reason to deny evidence. Also, I heard something like 98% of scientists believe Global Warming, but they're threatened so often that most of them are scared to say anything. Hopefully, at some point, people will wake up &amp; decide they have to do more than the puny amount they've done so far.

						The snow is finally starting to stick. I wonder how much it will pile up. The weather people said it's supposed to snow for a few days, but it didn't sound like much. I wish it would snow a lot. I like the snow &amp; have a whole bunch of stuff I would do in it. Before we ran out of snow, I started making igloos along with others. Sledding is always fun, but <span class="elaborate">I don't have a very good sled</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="2023/6/23">
							I later found out that it's not necessarily the (<span class="elaborate">one</span>) sled I had which was the problem; it was my size.<aside data-heading="Concession">There was at least one or two other sleds, but they weren't nearly as good, so I would never use them.</aside> I had a relatively small circular sled which worked fine for many years, but over time, it became harder and harder to sled. I attributed the problem to the accumulated scuff marks on the bottom along with a general mediocre construction in the first place and potentially insufficient snow. However, I rode on a substantially larger sled one day in non-ideal conditions, and I was able to sled quite well. It then occurred to me that the problem I had been having was likely due to the fact that I had grown and would now sink into the snow too much with my small sled for me to slide very easily.
						</aside>
						I always wanted to have a good snowball fight, but I couldn't get enough people together, &amp; the forts didn't provide much protection. We tried to make snowmen once or twice, but the problem is, grass would always get stuck in it, &amp; it wouldn't look that good. Another thing I would do when it was cold but not snowy was break up some of the ice of the pond &amp; skip/slide it across it. It makes a cool sound. This pond, though, is a little further away, &amp; I'm not sure if it's been cold enough for it to freeze over. I remember when the lake at the other house froze 5 inches thick. It will be a miracle if it even freezes an inch this year. All of you snow haters may be (have been, by the time you are reading this) having the time of your lives right now, but I'm still hoping we get some pretty good snow this year.

I'm not going to be satisfied just sitting around doing nothing or even sitting around doing only mediocre things. It's a waste to do anything but the best. I'll get this stuff done using my nearly completely unwavering determination. I know "nearly completely" doesn't sound as impressive, but that's about as sure as it gets with me. I have yet to see my confidence &amp; determination seriously rivaled by anyone. When I say something is happening, it's happening, whether you like it or not. It would take more than the apocalypse to stop it. Sure, there's varying degrees of my determination that have equally varying degrees of resistance that can stop it, but for some things, the entire universe could be against me, &amp; I'd still come out on top. One of those things is how I think I'm going to do great things. Not just <em>a</em> great thing, great thing<em>s</em>.

I originally had a simpler design, but it used tape on the mailbox, and I wasn't allowed to put tape on the mailbox. That design might be better than the one I ended up using; I didn't get to test it. In the end, however, I got the other design to work.

Wouldn't it just so happen that this is the year they play at our school. I probably would have put off making a decision on whether to go or not until it was too late, but I figured that I would never have the opportunity to play at our school again, so I ought to try.

							Throughout my time in band, there were only ever a few French Horn players in a band of about a hundred people, so it was rather surprising to me that, in a slightly smaller band, they would want over twice as many French Horn players.

							Even at the time, I thought this was a rather harsh statement to make (especially since the mailbox indicator was so cool), but I was quite let down that I'd never be able to perform for our school in Conference Band.
						</aside>
						I'll get over it, though. I think I hadn't practiced the stuff recently enough, &amp; I was nervous, so that didn't help. On a side note, I don't know what genius decided to put this thing that lasts until 9:00pm on a school night.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I think it turned out that I actually was 9<sup>th</sup> place which doesn't exactly help the situation because that would mean that I missed my only opportunity to play for the school by only one place after performing well below my true ability level. It still stings a little.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/7/3">
						A big issue with my audition (besides what I already stated) was that I don't think I ended up playing in the right key: The French Horn is notorious for producing similar-sounding notes while pressing down the same keys, and it does so irregularly, so if you don't recognize that the note you're playing isn't quite the right pitch but you try to match the effort and pitch difference required for going to the next note, you're going to miss every single note, and you won't be able to recognize the tune very well because some of the notes will be higher than they should be and others will be lower. A mistake like that can totally throw off your audition and then make it more likely you'll mess up afterwards because then you're extra nervous.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I decided that that description of a big issue with my audition was fairly confusing, so let me try again: With pretty much every instrument you blow air through, the sound that comes out depends not only on the keys you press down or holes you cover up but also on how you position and/or tighten your mouth. That's how a trumpet can play dozens of notes even though there are only 3 keys (8 combinations of pressed or unpressed). The Frech Horn is similar except for a fourth key and a hand in the bell which theoretically slightly changes the pitch (but no one in high school does anything with their hand). In most cases, however, the instrument kind-of locks you into a certain pitch, and the pitch won't change much until you make a relatively large change in your mouth, at which time the pitch jumps up or down a lot, and you can easily tell whether you're on the right note. With the French Horn you're still kind-of "locked in" to your note, but it takes much smaller changes in your mouth to jump to a different note, and the note you jump to is a lot closer in pitch to the note prior to the jump. Moreover, the pitch differences aren't the same for each combination of key presses, so rather than sounding like a song played in the wrong key if you get caught in the wrong pitch, it'll sound like a completely unrecognizable jumble of notes which don't follow the melody of the song (or scale) much at all, and you'll have a hard time determining whether you're trying to play slightly too high or slightly too low. (That's not to mention how some of the notes will actually be correct because the pitch difference to the next note is large enough that you get locked into the correct note, but you can't tell because the correct note doesn't sound right when all of the other notes are wrong.) I think I fell victim to this difficulty of the French Horn during my audition.

						People tell me far too many times that I have long eyelashes. It's weird. Once or twice in a long time is still weird, but more is just ridiculous. I don't know what possesses people (mostly girls) to tell me this. Once again, it's <em>weird</em>.
					</section>
					<div class="t14">
						<section>
							Speaking of weird girls, 2 people from my Explorations class (everyone calls it Odyssey, &amp; I'm not one to intentionally be an outsider, so that's what I'll call it) decided a few days ago, when they saw the person that normally sits across from me <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/12">at lunch</span> had moved &amp; was talking to someone else, that they would sit across from me. Today, since the person that moved away didn't go far, I told him jokingly, "You see what you've done? You moved away, &amp; now these people came over." I could tell they weren't offended, but they said, "Alright, we can take a hint." &amp; they moved to a different table. That was short-lived. I sort-of saw that coming before I said anything, but now I would have just kept quiet. It's nice to have people interested in me, &amp; that amount of people is slowly dwindling.
						</section>
						<section>
							At the beginning, most people were either just doing their own thing &amp; didn't pay attention to me or were really interested in me for some strange reason. If I had to guess, I'd say they were interested in me because I was new &amp; quiet which made most of me a mystery. I suppose less people care about the mystery now &amp; are beginning to do their own thing &amp; not pay attention to me. I can't remember how it went in 6<sup>th</sup> grade when I changed school districts, but I think I got more friends rather than a bunch of people losing interest in me. People still ask me for help on their work &amp; casually say something to me, but it's not the same.
						</section>
						<section class="t3">
							Sure, the obvious solution to this problem is to talk to more people, but I'm not that out-going. I often think that, if I either had a whole bunch of people to talk to or no one to talk to, I could be able to figure out how easily I could deal with both. You may think that I would obviously want to be around more people to not feel lonely, but I don't think it's that unlikely of a guess that, if I was ignored for long enough, I would get used to it, &amp; it wouldn't bother me that much.

They are as follows: 1) makes me feel awkward 2) does something particularly strange compared to the norm &amp; 3) I have some reason for jokingly insulting them. Only one requirement has to be met to be considered weird. I'd say she fits that first one with great precision, but she makes me feel important, &amp; I like feeling important.

						What is this mysterious topic you ask? Well, hopefully you're familiar with the version of this that involves squares. You would be given a square that is made up of a bunch of smaller squares. Then you would be asked to find all the squares. Say you had a 3 by 3 square. First, you would notice that there are 9 of the small squares. Since all the squares don't have to be the same size, you would start looking for bigger ones. The next size up from 1 by 1 squares are the 2 by 2 ones. You would see ther are 4 of them. Finally, there is the one, big 3 by 3 square. That brings the total up to 14 squares in all. Tessellation conglomerates are based on that sort of idea. I have worked extensively on it &amp; have come up with all sorts of formulas to solve it. I have went on to different shapes &amp; exceptions &amp; slowly conquered each challenge. It would take me forever to explain it all to you.

I don't have instantaneous access of this journal, so I have time to think about how to perfect the wording.

I'm not getting rid of my article, so when I make the website, I won't have to redo it.

						So, yesterday was Valentine's Day. I, of course, didn't have a valentine, but that doesn't matter to me too much. Besides, moving here over summer &amp; being shy doesn't exactly give me a head start. Apparently, there have been studies about Valentine's Day that say, to be the best valentine, you ought to wear red, carry a hot drink, &amp; speak into the person's right ear. Also, dark chocolate is best at first, but eventually, milk chocolate overtakes it. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/14">(Although, in my opinion, dark chocolate always wins.)</span> I don't understand some of that stuff, but oh well.

						There were these things called candygrams that people could buy at the school that would be given out during Academic Advisory. I was very surprised 2 days ago when I received one. Obviously, I was curious who would get me one, but I didn't have to wait long to find out. Since I don't have to change rooms, like most people do, to go to Academic Advisory, my teacher decided to give it to me before the previous class was over. <span class="p0">One of the people who sent it</span> saw me getting it &amp; said, "Oh, is that our valentine (might have said candygram)? We love you Robert!" Eventually, I read it, &amp; it said it was from p43, p44, &amp; p45 (people from my Odyssey class). At the bottom, underneath the typed print of "You're Awesome!!!!", was written, "Thanks for being such a good sport this year!" It had never seemed to me that anyone in that class (except slightly p38) payed very much attention to me at all. It still doesn't seem that way, but it gives me a new perspective. In the "To" part of the card was "Robert T. Benson". They got that from when, a long time ago, they saw a part on Wikipedia on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can_telephone">Tin can telephone</a> article that I added about making them go around corners. I had come up with the technique, so I put my name &amp; added the T so I wouldn't be confused with a Robert Benson already on Wikipedia. As you should already know, Wikipedia doesn't like original research, so it was almost completely deleted but not before they saw it. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">Extra information</span> Another ridiculous thing they say about my name is that it sounds like a fashion designer's name. Now, I wouldn't know what a fashion designer's name would sound like, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that my main profession is <em>not</em> going to be a fashion designer. That won't keep them from trying to convince me, though.

						Since Wikipedia has version control, you can still see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tin_can_telephone&diff=511668331&oldid=511570032">here</a> the section I added which was deleted. I say my section was "<em>almost</em> completely" deleted because, later on, a relatively small part was kept because I dug up a reference for a different (less effective) tactic. It seems that, during this beginning stage of my time on Wikipedia, I wasn't familiar enough with how changes were recorded to know how to see the history of changes and see the associated explanations. One of my big issues with my section being deleted was that "no explanation" was given, and I firmly expressed my discontent on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tin_can_telephone#Changes_made_to_this_article">the article's talk page</a> (a somewhat hidden part of every article meant for discussing the content). The people in Odyssey also read that, and <span class="person p44">one of them</span> said how they would go to me the next time they needed to write a strongly-worded letter. It turns out that there actually was a very brief edit description referencing unsourced original research, and I'm a little embarrassed now for so boldly referencing myself, but I was trying my best, and I had a somewhat different perspective of Wikipedia at the time. Also, it's quite a frustrating experience to know something you want to share, but you don't have any way of proving what you know (besides challenging people to try it themselves). This isn't as much of a problem for me anymore now that I can make websites easily, but you better have some solid references if you're going to put anything on Wikipedia. This isn't the end of my time on the Tin can telephone Wikipedia article, though.

						I'd say 13 hours is a new record for time slept by me. You can't sleep much longer without being in a coma. I think I've trained my body to sleep a long time on Saturday to make up for the sleep I don't get during the week. I had 3 dreams last night about catching mice.

					<section class="t13">
						Yesterday, I put the finishing touches on my mouse trap. My parents have said how they're going to get something to catch the mice, but that won't happen for a very long time assuming it even does. I decided to take matters into my own hands &amp; used a bunch of popsickle sticks &amp; tape to create a mouse trap. It's a sort of box that has an opening on one end. I attached a "door" to the opening at the top &amp; had the bottom slanted inwards. This way, the mice could push in through the door, but when they tried to push out, the door would be stopped by the bottom, &amp; they couldn't get out. Yesterday, I put it all in a pretzel bag to disguise it &amp; baited it with a pretzel. I think the door was too hard to push in because the pretzel is still in there &amp; no mouse. I made the door a little easier for them to push in, so maybe I'll get a mouse tonight. Hopefully, the popsickle sticks are tough enough to not be nibbled through.

Maybe I'm too used to people not giving me a second thought, so when they do, it means more to me than it would normally. This is probably why I think about p38 so much.

Moreover, I'm pretty sure I knew for a fact that at least one of the people who sent me the candygram definitely did have the same math teacher.

						Today has been our first snow day. If you'll notice the date, I'd consider this far too late to have our <em>first</em> snow day. P1 had me shovel a ridiculous amount. You would think that the amount of sleet that came along with the snow would make it good snow to make snowballs with, but it didn't. Among these random thoughts is the one that I should have done something fun in it. Maybe I didn't because I don't have anyone to do anything with. Maybe it's because I'd have to put on too many layers, &amp; I don't want to go through all that trouble. Maybe it's just because there isn't really that much to do anyway; I can't have a snowball fight (no people to have it with), I can't sled (my sled gets stuck in the snow because, as I recently thought of, I weigh more than when I was a little kid), I can't make an igloo (I wouldn't trust the mediocre snow), making a snow angel wouldn't keep me interested that long, &amp; I'm not sure how well a snowman would hold up. Most likely, I didn't do anything because of all those reasons combined. I don't think any one of those reasons would have deterred me.

						On a different note, my social studies teacher, p47, has her birthday today. She was saying how she would not be happy if we didn't have a snow day today. During class, she showed us a website that I think was called snow day calculator. You typed in a few things &amp; it would tell you how likely it is to have a snow day. Today was 99%. Tomorrow was 84%. We're having a snow day tomorrow, so I'd say that website is pretty good. Four-day weekend!

						Yesterday, a fairly important thing happened to me. A while ago, my Odyssey class wrote essays about "what giftedness means to a gifted student". I won 3<sup>rd</sup> place for highschool in the state. Whoever got 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> got to go to <span class="elaborate">Jefferson City</span> to be recognized. <aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Extra information" data-date="2023/11/15">The capital of Missouri</aside> The strange thing is, both 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> were also in my class: p48 &amp; p49. I was wondering how many people actually entered the contest, but the person coordinating the event said 250 people entered. If everyone was evenly distributed between elementary, middle, &amp; high school, there would be about 83 or 84 people competing. You can figure out the probability of the 3 highschool winners being in the same class if you're feeling ambitious. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">I'm feeling ambitious.</span>
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection t13" data-heading="Nerding out" data-date="2023/11/15">
						To make the numbers a little easier to work with (and provide a more generous probability in the end), let's assume the participants were skewed a little towards the elementary and middle school categories and that there were only 80 entries in the high school category. There are over 550 school districts in Missouri, but they obviously didn't all enter. Let's assume that the average class size in the schools that entered was my class size (8) which would mean that 10 schools entered (&lt;2% of all schools in Missouri). (Actually, that assumption wouldn't matter, but it's interesting to gague what the participant pool might've been like.) The probability of any particular school having a winner (if there was only one) would be 8 in 80 (10%). However, since having a winner reduces the number of people left who can win, the probability of having a second winner would be 7 in 79, and a third would be 6 in 78. To get the probability of getting all 3 winners, you would need to multiply all of the probabilities (8/80 &times; 7/79 &times; 6/78) which would give a chance of about 0.068%. You could expect all 3 winners to come from the same high school only once every 1,471 times you held the essay contest (which would also be the number of years you'd have to wait for that outcome in a yearly essay contest). Note how the way I determined the probability of all 3 winners being from my class doesn't actually depend on how many schools entered or what their class sizes were, so this should be a fairly reliable probability; however, given such extremely slim odds, I can't help but second-guess my calculations and wonder how something like this could've been possible. Even if there were only 50 participants in high school, there would still only be a 0.29% chance. You would have to bring the participants down to 33 just to have a 1% chance. Also, although I don't think I would make that kind of mistake, if you went by strictly what was written here, you could interpret "250 people entered" to mean "250 people were in the high school category" which would bring the likelihood down to 0.0022%. Am I missing something here?

						I couldn't find the original essay contest, but it seems to have been conducted by the <a href="http://www.mogam.org/">Gifted Association of Missouri</a> with a Capitol Building celebration agenda similar to the one <a href="http://www.mogam.org/gam-at-the-capitol.html">here</a>.

It turns out, the p48.lastName()s are p48's family. Something funny I noticed about the back of their van is that it said "Odyssey". I guess it was the Odyssey model of the van. After a bunch of confusion about where to park &amp; where to go, we finally made it.

					<section>
						There were a lot more people than you would expect, most of which (other than adults) were noticeably younger. Do people really become that much older-looking between middle achool &amp; high school? There was also a video contest, so there was even more people.

						Before anyone did much of anything, some people led us to watch Congress. The first thing they (&amp; we) did was pray &amp; say the Pledge of Allegiance. My immediate first thought was, "They aren't doing a very good job of separation of church &amp; state." They pray at the inauguration of the president too. It makes me wonder what goes through these people's heads when they decide to do this.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, after that, they started this extremely long, drawn-out, ridiculous process of introducing people including us. Also, even though they told us to turn off our phones &amp; don't bring any food or drinks, I saw the Congress people using their phones, &amp; they had all sorts of drinks. All of those people didn't even seem to be paying attention to whoever was talking. If that many people had side conversations in a classroom, the teacher's head would explode. I think I figured out why nothing gets done in Congress &amp; why everyone complains about them.
					</section>
					<section>
						Once everyone got tired of listening to them, they took us back to the first floor. When we were there, they talked some &amp; started handing out awards. The awards were just pieces of paper. The first place people got an envelope as well that I think might have had a check. I don't think my essay was deserving of 3<sup>rd</sup> place. I ramble on about my life &amp; don't make much of a point. If I knew the essay was also supposed to promote gifted education (a part which the instructions left out), I think I could have made it better. To be fair to myself, the more I look at anything I did, the worse I think I did at it with <em>very</em> few exceptions. I still think I could have done better, though. p48 (who won first) said how she finds it hard to believe that her essay was best in the state, but I don't think it's that hard to believe.

There were individual pictures, &amp; then they tried to get me in a group picture with p48 &amp; p49 (1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup>). They weren't even satisfied with me standing on the side; they made me go in between them. I didn't get second, so why do I have to stand in the middle? There were a few, more serious, pictures taken, &amp; then they wanted to take a goofy one. I'm not one for goofy photos, so I didn't really do anything, but both of them did. At first, they didn't know what to do, but then they decided to lean up against me, turn to the side, make a gun with both of their hands, &amp; point it in the air like people do in action movies. It was weird.

						Afterwards, we were encouraged to talk to our representatives &amp; senators to stress the importance of the gifted program.
					</section>
					<section>
						Before I go on, here is my view on the gifted program. I think that their heart is in the right place, but they're going about it the wrong way. For one thing, Odyssey is, by far, the least productive class out of any other. It's probably the nicest but definitely the least productive. People say how they like the challenge, but Odyssey isn't challenging. We skim over a variety of topics but never get in-depth enough to make it challenging. I think there ought to be advanced classes, so there will be a challenging class for whichever subject someone's good at. Also, I think they ought to do classes like they do in highschool earlier. People should be able to take classes based on their ability level. Anyway, that's my point of view.
					</section>
					<section>
						Back to the Capitol Building, there was some guide that led us to our representative &amp; senator. It turns out that our representative was Speaker of the House. There was a photographer apparently following him to take pictures. He seemed nice &amp; gave us pens. It was black &amp; said, "p50.firstName.string.toUpperCase p50.middleName.string.0. p50.lastName.string.toUpperCase SPEAKER" in golden print. Later, we found our senator, &amp; when he was told 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> were from his district, he said, "Of course, what did you expect?" He seemed nice as well.
					</section>
					<section>
						There wasn't much else to do after that, so we eventually left. Before we went very far, we found a place to eat. I'm not used to being given that much food. I still ate it all, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						During the drive back, we stopped at my grandparents' (on my mom's side) house because they were on the way. We talked, &amp; they wanted to see my essay, but I didn't have it. I'm getting more &amp; more reluctant to let people read my essay because I keep thinking it's worse &amp; worse. I really don't think it's very good. At the very least, it's not very good compared to my standards for myself. After awhile, we left my grandparents' house &amp; went home. Pretty fascinating story, huh.

					</section>
					<section>
						What? You want to know what's going on with the seconds? Well, somewhere around 6<sup>th</sup> grade or a little earlier, I decided it would be cool to figure out how many seconds there are until things. I always keep track of how many seconds are until next year &amp;, when they're about a month away, Christmas &amp; my birthday. At some point, I may step it up but not right now. Since everyone knows when Christmas &amp; next year is, the only mystery is when my birthday is. Once I start keeping track of how many seconds there are until my birthday, you aren't going to get the actual day out of me. Usually, people are too lazy to pick up a calculator to put their curiosity to rest.
					</section>
					<section>
						Three years ago, p19 surprised me by figuring out when my birthday was based on the seconds. I didn't even realize he was figuring it out until he told me when it was.
					</section>
					<section class="t15">
						For the record, I figure out the seconds on a daily basis. Right after I tell people how many seconds there are until something, they usually wait a second &amp; ask "How many is it now?" I realize they're just trying to be funny, but <em>everyone</em> tries to be funny in the same way. Besides, in that many seconds, it will still be my birth<em>day</em>. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/18">I also get complaints about how I'm calculating to midnight instead of the time of my birth, but besides the fact that it's easier to work with whole numbers of days, people would then change their mind and start complaining that I wasn't calculating to the beginning of the day, anyway. If I was born at 11:59pm, would my birthday only last one minute? I think not, so I'm calculating to midnight, and you all can just get over it.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						Today, I was telling people that there's 604,800 seconds until my birthday, &amp; p51 decided she'd figure out when it was. She did it the hard way by going through minutes &amp; hours (like p19 did). The easier way is to know how many seconds are in a day (86,400). When I finally put in the effort to memorize it, there was so much less trouble. If you knew me &amp; thought it would have been cool to have your name published someplace but it's not in here, maybe you shouldn't have been so lazy &amp; figured out when my birthday is, so you could have been put in here. It's <em>really</em> pathetic that only 2 people in 4 years have figured out when my birthday is based on the seconds. I think my math teacher will figure it out when I see her tomorrow, but still, I shouldn't be able to keep track of each person who does it; it's not that hard to do. People are lazy.

						I think I overreact when people are nice to me. You wouldn't be able to tell, but when people compliment me or act interested in me, I end up really liking that person for that period of time. For a while now, I've been fooled into thinking that I'm liking the whole person in general rather than just the way they're treating me at the time. Of course, the way a person treats me at the time is a large part of who they are in general, but I've noticed that I don't like them nearly as strongly when they seem to not notice me much at all. If I liked the person in general, it wouldn't really matter if they were paying attention to me or not. I know it's hard to be convinced of the validity of this argument, but I guess the main point I'm trying to get across is that I have control of my emotions again.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't like the feeling that there is something about myself that I can't control. That includes my emotions. I don't like having a hard time deciding the right thing to do because my emotions are clouding my judgement. Sure, happy emotions are good, but I don't want to blindly do other things for them &amp; not be able to think it through. It's just the concept of me doing anything that I can't think through or control that I don't like. Keeping full control over my emotions &amp; actions, though, probably keeps me from letting loose a bunch of the time. P1 has compared me to a vulcan from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek"><i>Star Trek</i></a> &amp; a robot. I think those comparisons are pretty extreme, especially in the way he impersonates them, but I will admit that I am less emotional than most people. I have enough emotion to sympathize &amp; still feel things, but the rest is very mild.
					</section>
					<section>
						So anyway, I have rationalized yet another feeling &amp; now can control it. Even though I doubt this will be the last time this sort of thing happens, I am much more at ease knowing I can explain my emotions &amp; actions. Hopefully you haven't been too bored with me summarizing stuff I've said before in a rambling sort of way (which is about how I feel I made my essay that I got 3<sup>rd</sup> place on).

						IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!!! WHOO HOO!!!! There are now only 31,536,000 seconds until my birthday. Or 0 seconds, whichever you prefer.

						Each year, there are 3 times that I'm determined to stay happy during. One of those is Christmas. Another is for as long as possible during summer break. The last is, you guessed it, my birthday. I'd say I'm doing a fantastic job at it. I have so much more energy &amp; feel great. Being happy is awesome! Who would have thought? I'm not necessarily sad most of the time, but I'm not necessarily happy most of the time either, just sort-of indifferent. I almost feel like a different person with so much happiness. I've <em>really</em> pumped myself up for my birthday. I'm surprised there's that much in me.

						At the beginning of 1<sup>st</sup> hour, I received a happy birthday paper &amp; a Tootsie Pop from the principal like everyone does on their birthday. Two out of four classes sung happy birthday for me. Something I think is strange is how p52, whose birthday is the same as mine, didn't get as much attention for his birthday. He's had more time to get to know more people &amp; is more out-going, so why would he not get, at least, equally noticed? It happens with other people as well. Every once in awhile, I hear someone say, "Oh, it's your birthday today? Well, happy birthday!" And that's all there is to it.

						I don't understand why, in the relatively small amount of time people notice me, people act like they've known me all their lives &amp; that we're best friends but don't do that for most other people. I've speculated before but come to no definate conclusion. Random people in the halls that I don't even know have done the same thing. I don't get it.

						Continuing on with my day, one person asked if I was getting my permit <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/21">since I was now 15</span>. No. I doubt if I will for a long time. A different thing that happened is p38, I think specifically because it was my birthday, decided it would be funny to try to tickle the back of my neck when everyone was leaving the lunch room. It was weird. Not much else happened at school.

						When I got home, I didn't expect anyone to get home for a very long time because there had been problems with a car &amp; my parents decided my birthday would be the perfect time to fix it. To my surprise, p2 showed up a lot earlier with some balloons. Once p1 finally got home, we ate chocolate cake &amp; Ice Cream Oreo Cake after I blew out the candles. There were 15 candles arranged in the shape of 15 (guess how old I am). I got one present with a few things in it. The main things were a black light in the shape of those curly fluorescent lightbulbs &amp; a mini FM radio. They're pretty cool. Birthdays are awesome!

						Yesterday, I made the most amazing igloo ever single-handedly. I mostly used snow from off the cars that p2 gave to me. It took me the whole day to make it, but in the end, I had a fairly roomy igloo that you could lay down in. My parents compared it to a cocoon &amp; a mud dauber nest. Usually, I don't agree with my parents' comparisons, but I have to admit that it looks a whole lot like that. While I was building my amazing igloo, p1 made an enormous snowman; it must be arount 6 feet tall. He made a surprisingly good face to go along with it.

						Now would probably be a good time to mention it's spring. There has been more winter-like weather now than there was in winter, but the groundhog said it was going to be an early spring.
					</section>
					<section class="t15">
						That brings up another point. Groundhog's Day is the most ridiculous day there ever was. What genius put a <em>groundhog</em> in charge of saying what <em>season</em> it is! It makes no sense! Isn't it strange how everyone can tell when summer, fall, &amp; winter starts, but they need to ask a groundhog when spring starts. There's probably some sentimental reason behind it, but it's time to move on. It's just ridiculous.
