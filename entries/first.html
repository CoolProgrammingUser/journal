				This is where I start writing entries as the things are happening to me. I had more to say here, but it changed when I moved the first huge entry to its own <a href="prequel" target="_self">prequel</a> page, and I'm not motivated to update it right now.
			</section>
			<section style="display:none">
				This will recount every important event in my life from birth to the first time I shared this journal with someone (in 10<sup>th</sup> grade). Keep in mind that, although I've added some things and tried to reformat others, this was originally written completely in notebooks with no expectation of it being put into a website (at least not any time soon). I also didn't bother with putting paragraph breaks anywhere for a long time, so I just made up wherever I thought was a good spot (which is pretty much what I do now anyway). In case you don't glance over the <a href="../indicators.html" target="_self">Indicators</a> page first (which you should) or you don't know how to interpret what I said, the things I've added at a time later than the date shown at the beginning of the entry are indicated with an <span class="afterthought">afterthought</span> styling, and <span class="elaborate">dotted underlines</span> and people's names are clickable.
				<aside data-heading="Seriously?">Did you really just click on that?</aside>
				Upon copying the content into this website, I tried to reword the introduction of my journal in the first entry since that was the one place I gave myself permission to make sure everything was relevant to my audience when it came time to publish (which I originally imagined to be in a book); however, as I got farther along in my copying efforts, I noticed the occasional reference back to the way the introduction was originally written, and I wasn't about to update every small reference to the way things were (assuming I'd be able to catch them all), and that level of revision bordered on rewriting my history anyway (since, for example, I may have decided to write about something I mentioned in the introduction because I forgot to do so elsewhere), so I brought back the original introduction. You'll probably find it interesting to read how I introduced my journal when I was 14, anyway. In case you're wondering (or will wonder), it's because of this type of problem that I also didn't cut and paste the events from my childhood into the correct order (since outlining first is for losers, and I didn't remember everything in order). I corrected the occasional spelling error (which I wouldn't have made in the first place if I had spellcheck or if English wasn't dumb), and I might've made a small revision if I thought something was unclear or hard-to-follow, but it's quite rare that I did anything at all (besides <span class="afterthought">add stuff</span>) because I didn't make many mistakes in the first place (in my opinion), and I wanted to keep as much of my original writing style in-tact as possible.

						Christmas was pretty good. The presents keep getting less interesting, but I realize we don't have much money, &amp; I was told I should figure out what I want. It's not like I don't want anything; I just can't think of everything at once. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">I would also never dwell much on what I wanted because I knew there was essentially no chance of us buying it, and allowing myself to imagine having it would just make me upset that I couldn't have it. However, with purging my mind of such thoughts, it also made it more difficult for me to think of what I wanted when given the opportunity.</span> We went to <span class="person p40">my aunt</span>'s house after a while. There were less people there than usual. We also did less than usual. I don't know what happened. We ate, &amp; later I got to open two extra presents. Everyone pretty much just talked the rest of the time, but we played a few, small games. There wasn't too much else that happened.
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						I forgot two big things that happened in high school so far, so I guess I'll put it here. The first thing was all over the news. Some person in band was voted homecoming queen as a joke. It was said that people would humiliate her during the homecoming parade <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/6/26">(which I was in with the band)</span>, but everyone made sure that didn't happen. P1 was also interviewed about it for the news, &amp; we recorded it.
					</section>
					<section class="t11">
						Another thing was a bomb threat at the school. Apparently, someone spraypainted on one of the bathroom walls that they were going to blow up the school. We were all evacuated, but no bomb was found. We weren't allowed to go back to get our stuff, so I was locked outside the house for a few hours.
					</section>
					<section>
						Pacific doesn't strike me as a particularly inhospitable place, &amp; I don't think it used to be one either, but they could have gotten off on a better foot than that. What's even more sad is I think both of these things happened during the first quarter of school or close to it.

						It's been warm lately. This is the second time it's flurried this entire fall &amp; winter. Not even snow, just flurries. I don't think it snowed much last year either. The summer was really hot &amp; dry too. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/6/26">(I can't say for sure anymore, but I'm pretty much certain that the dryness only applied to the ground and rainfall, not the air which can still manage to be humid.)</span> They say food prices are going to go up a litte next year because of the smaller amount of crops that survived. We had a pretty consistant temperature of about 100 (Fahrenheit) for a long time. Now, it's hardly gotten below freezing every once in a while. It sure makes you want to believe in Global Warming. It's not like I haven't believed in Global Warming. I just haven't really seen any effects of it. I don't get why people are so against believing it. All they're doing is making it worse. The reason I believe is because I tend to believe calm, serious people rather than people frantically &amp; blindly searching for a reason to deny evidence. Also, I heard something like 98% of scientists believe Global Warming, but they're threatened so often that most of them are scared to say anything. Hopefully, at some point, people will wake up &amp; decide they have to do more than the puny amount they've done so far.

						The snow is finally starting to stick. I wonder how much it will pile up. The weather people said it's supposed to snow for a few days, but it didn't sound like much. I wish it would snow a lot. I like the snow &amp; have a whole bunch of stuff I would do in it. Before we ran out of snow, I started making igloos along with others. Sledding is always fun, but <span class="elaborate">I don't have a very good sled</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Elaboration" data-date="2023/6/23">
							I later found out that it's not necessarily the (<span class="elaborate">one</span>) sled I had which was the problem; it was my size.<aside data-heading="Concession">There was at least one or two other sleds, but they weren't nearly as good, so I would never use them.</aside> I had a relatively small circular sled which worked fine for many years, but over time, it became harder and harder to sled. I attributed the problem to the accumulated scuff marks on the bottom along with a general mediocre construction in the first place and potentially insufficient snow. However, I rode on a substantially larger sled one day in non-ideal conditions, and I was able to sled quite well. It then occurred to me that the problem I had been having was likely due to the fact that I had grown and would now sink into the snow too much with my small sled for me to slide very easily.
						</aside>
						I always wanted to have a good snowball fight, but I couldn't get enough people together, &amp; the forts didn't provide much protection. We tried to make snowmen once or twice, but the problem is, grass would always get stuck in it, &amp; it wouldn't look that good. Another thing I would do when it was cold but not snowy was break up some of the ice of the pond &amp; skip/slide it across it. It makes a cool sound. This pond, though, is a little further away, &amp; I'm not sure if it's been cold enough for it to freeze over. I remember when the lake at the other house froze 5 inches thick. It will be a miracle if it even freezes an inch this year. All of you snow haters may be (have been, by the time you are reading this) having the time of your lives right now, but I'm still hoping we get some pretty good snow this year.

						It has occurred to me that I haven't told you what I'm going to become famous for. Assuming, with the great confidence I posess, that I become as famous as I plan to, you should already know this, but I'll tell you anyway. I am going to do things such as cure things, create new technology, make great discoveries, &amp; other, various important things. I'm not going to be satisfied just sitting around doing nothing or even sitting around doing only mediocre things. It's a waste to do anything but the best. I'll get this stuff done using my nearly completely unwavering determination. I know "nearly completely" doesn't sound as impressive, but that's about as sure as it gets with me. I have yet to see my confidence &amp; determination seriously rivaled by anyone. When I say something is happening, it's happening, whether you like it or not. It would take more than the apocalypse to stop it. Sure, there's varying degrees of my determination that have equally varying degrees of resistance that can stop it, but for some things, the entire universe could be against me, &amp; I'd still come out on top. One of those things is how I think I'm going to do great things. Not just <em>a</em> great thing, great thing<em>s</em>. If I didn't believe that with the utmost certainty, I wouldn't be writing this now. There's nothing you can do to stop me, so don't waste your time. I'm glad we got that cleared up.

						Yesterday I finished something awesome. I thought I should come up with a way to tell if there was mail in the mailbox, so I wouldn't have to check it, when coming off the school bus, only to find that nothing's there. I originally had a simpler design, but it used tape on the mailbox, and I wasn't allowed to put tape on the mailbox. That design might be better than the one I ended up using; I didn't get to test it. In the end, however, I got the other design to work. The basic idea is that the mail-person has to open the mailbox to put in the mail. I have something set up so that a certain amount of string is let go when the door opens which lets <span class="elaborate">the weighted side</span><aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/6/27">The side with a rock tied to it</aside> on a rotatable <span class="elaborate">"flag"</span> down,<aside data-heading="Explanation">A stick with something tied at the top</aside> so the flag turns up.

I'm so happy that this actually worked because I'm tired of telling people I'm going to do something cool but then have to say how it didn't work. It gets disheartening after a while. I can now finally share a recent success story.

						Today has been the auditions for Conference Band. The band teachers say that the Conference Band plays at a school for an assembly once a year &amp; that they play once every 4 years at our school. Wouldn't it just so happen that this is the year they play at our school. I probably would have put off making a decision on whether to go or not until it was too late, but I figured that I would never have the opportunity to play at our school again, so I ought to try.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought t24" data-date="2013/1/9">
						I didn't make it. That stinks. They went to 8 places <span class="elaborate">(which is more than I thought they would)</span>,
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
							Throughout my time in band, there were only ever a few French Horn players in a band of about a hundred people, so it was rather surprising to me that, in a slightly smaller band, they would want over twice as many French Horn players.
						</aside>
						so the best I could have been was 9<sup>th</sup> out of, I think, 12 people. <span class="elaborate">So much for recent success stories.</span>
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Concession" data-date="2023/7/3">
							Even at the time, I thought this was a rather harsh statement to make (especially since the mailbox indicator was so cool), but I was quite let down that I'd never be able to perform for our school in Conference Band.
						</aside>
						I'll get over it, though. I think I hadn't practiced the stuff recently enough, &amp; I was nervous, so that didn't help. On a side note, I don't know what genius decided to put this thing that lasts until 9:00pm on a school night.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I think it turned out that I actually was 9<sup>th</sup> place which doesn't exactly help the situation because that would mean that I missed my only opportunity to play for the school by only one place after performing well below my true ability level. It still stings a little.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/7/3">
						A big issue with my audition (besides what I already stated) was that I don't think I ended up playing in the right key: The French Horn is notorious for producing similar-sounding notes while pressing down the same keys, and it does so irregularly, so if you don't recognize that the note you're playing isn't quite the right pitch but you try to match the effort and pitch difference required for going to the next note, you're going to miss every single note, and you won't be able to recognize the tune very well because some of the notes will be higher than they should be and others will be lower. A mistake like that can totally throw off your audition and then make it more likely you'll mess up afterwards because then you're extra nervous.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/10">
						I decided that that description of a big issue with my audition was fairly confusing, so let me try again: With pretty much every instrument you blow air through, the sound that comes out depends not only on the keys you press down or holes you cover up but also on how you position and/or tighten your mouth. That's how a trumpet can play dozens of notes even though there are only 3 keys (8 combinations of pressed or unpressed). The Frech Horn is similar except for a fourth key and a hand in the bell which theoretically slightly changes the pitch (but no one in high school does anything with their hand). In most cases, however, the instrument kind-of locks you into a certain pitch, and the pitch won't change much until you make a relatively large change in your mouth, at which time the pitch jumps up or down a lot, and you can easily tell whether you're on the right note. With the French Horn you're still kind-of "locked in" to your note, but it takes much smaller changes in your mouth to jump to a different note, and the note you jump to is a lot closer in pitch to the note prior to the jump. Moreover, the pitch differences aren't the same for each combination of key presses, so rather than sounding like a song played in the wrong key if you get caught in the wrong pitch, it'll sound like a completely unrecognizable jumble of notes which don't follow the melody of the song (or scale) much at all, and you'll have a hard time determining whether you're trying to play slightly too high or slightly too low. (That's not to mention how some of the notes will actually be correct because the pitch difference to the next note is large enough that you get locked into the correct note, but you can't tell because the correct note doesn't sound right when all of the other notes are wrong.) I think I fell victim to this difficulty of the French Horn during my audition.

						I've noticed something that I've never noticed before. Apparently, when I'm sitting, I fairly slowly &amp; softly tap my foot when I feel awkward. I find it hard to believe that this has escaped my attention for so long. I guess I can't really do that while I'm standing &amp; presenting something because I need that foot to balance on, &amp; all other things that would make me feel awkward, I avoid.

						People tell me far too many times that I have long eyelashes. It's weird. Once or twice in a long time is still weird, but more is just ridiculous. I don't know what possesses people (mostly girls) to tell me this. Once again, it's <em>weird</em>.
					</section>
					<div class="t14">
						<section class="t24">
							Speaking of weird girls, 2 people from my Explorations class (everyone calls it Odyssey, &amp; I'm not one to intentionally be an outsider, so that's what I'll call it) decided a few days ago, when they saw the person that normally sits across from me <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/12">at lunch</span> had moved &amp; was talking to someone else, that they would sit across from me. Today, since the person that moved away didn't go far, I told him jokingly, "You see what you've done? You moved away, &amp; now these people came over." I could tell they weren't offended, but they said, "Alright, we can take a hint." &amp; they moved to a different table. That was short-lived. I sort-of saw that coming before I said anything, but now I would have just kept quiet. It's nice to have people interested in me, &amp; that amount of people is slowly dwindling.
						</section>
						<section>
							At the beginning, most people were either just doing their own thing &amp; didn't pay attention to me or were really interested in me for some strange reason. If I had to guess, I'd say they were interested in me because I was new &amp; quiet which made most of me a mystery. I suppose less people care about the mystery now &amp; are beginning to do their own thing &amp; not pay attention to me. I can't remember how it went in 6<sup>th</sup> grade when I changed school districts, but I think I got more friends rather than a bunch of people losing interest in me. People still ask me for help on their work &amp; casually say something to me, but it's not the same.
						</section>
						<section class="t3">
							Sure, the obvious solution to this problem is to talk to more people, but I'm not that out-going. I often think that, if I either had a whole bunch of people to talk to or no one to talk to, I could be able to figure out how easily I could deal with both. You may think that I would obviously want to be around more people to not feel lonely, but I don't think it's that unlikely of a guess that, if I was ignored for long enough, I would get used to it, &amp; it wouldn't bother me that much.

						I think that, as long as I haven't had people around me recently &amp; don't expect people to come around in the future, being alone isn't that bad. It does, however, come in waves like me being bored with school. Sometimes it's just fine, &amp; other times it flares up. It would be a rare occasion for you to notice any difference, though.

						I've noticed (assuming I'm correct) that p38 is trying to keep me from being lonely. The only reason there's any doubt is because it's only noticeable for an extremely short period of time. Pretty much every time she sees that I see her, she smiles &amp; waves at me, so I wave back. Also, each time I walk into the Odyssey classroom, I get complimented. I don't really know what to say in that split second, so I don't say anything, &amp; it makes me feel like I'm being mean &amp; ignoring her.

						I realize that I was calling her weird not all that long ago, but I think she's figured out that I don't respond well to all that weird stuff, &amp; she's toned it down.

They are as follows: 1) makes me feel awkward 2) does something particularly strange compared to the norm &amp; 3) I have some reason for jokingly insulting them. Only one requirement has to be met to be considered weird. I'd say she fits that first one with great precision, but she makes me feel important, &amp; I like feeling important.

						Wikipedia is awesome. Yesterday, I finished my first article for it. I'm having people look it over before I submit it. You don't have to submit an article to get it on Wikipedia, but it's encouraged that you do. My article is titled Tessellation conglomerate right now. That title is completely made up by me. I have no idea what it's really called assuming there actually is a name for it. I just picked what I thought would fit it fairly well &amp; went with that.

						What is this mysterious topic you ask? Well, hopefully you're familiar with the version of this that involves squares. You would be given a square that is made up of a bunch of smaller squares. Then you would be asked to find all the squares. Say you had a 3 by 3 square. First, you would notice that there are 9 of the small squares. Since all the squares don't have to be the same size, you would start looking for bigger ones. The next size up from 1 by 1 squares are the 2 by 2 ones. You would see ther are 4 of them. Finally, there is the one, big 3 by 3 square. That brings the total up to 14 squares in all. Tessellation conglomerates are based on that sort of idea. I have worked extensively on it &amp; have come up with all sorts of formulas to solve it. I have went on to different shapes &amp; exceptions &amp; slowly conquered each challenge. It would take me forever to explain it all to you.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/13">
						Fun fact: I started working on Tessellation conglomerates in 8<sup>th</sup> grade after someone from the high school visited my math class &amp; said how we would figure out how to solve those kinds of puzzles when we went there (but I wouldn't learn it because I wouldn't be going to that high school).

Luckily, someone suggested a website, <a href="https://oeis.org/">OEIS</a> (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), that helped give some of my stuff legitimacy. I'm just hoping my article makes it. I can deal with anything else later.

						Today was an Odyssey field trip. We went to a Holocaust museum. As you can guess, it's not the most joyful trip. It wasn't that bad for me, though. Things have a tendency not to sink in for me. I can still understand all of it &amp; care that it happened, but it doesn't ever overwhelm me, so actually, I'm thankful for it.

						I rarely realize how overwhelming something actually is until, for some reason, it abruptly goes away. It just keeps building up very slowly, so slowly that it seems like an overall change of my personality or circumstances, but when it suddenly disappears, I realize it was just a wave. I feel so much better after it's gone. It's like when you're outside, in the cold, &amp; then you come into a warm house where it finally hits you how cold you were. I wish I knew what makes it suddenly go away because I like warm houses.

					<section>
						The most recently passing wave is loneliness. I doubt anyone could tell a wave was going by because I usually keep my emotions to myself. I'm not sure if even you could tell. Besides, I don't think you've read enough to tell what's normal for me. Also, anything that gets written in here has already gone through my head a whole bunch of times. I don't have instantaneous access of this journal, so I have time to think about how to perfect the wording. I make sure to not put in anything I'm going to regret later or cause others to think that certain things are being distorted due to my view on them. In the end, you might not have been able to tell that I was getting pretty lonely. Hopefully, this lull in the loneliness sticks around awhile.

						I think it's so annoying when someone mistakes me for someone else with red hair. They don't even have to sort-of look like me, just have red hair. You would think that people have been around other humans enough to have more ways of distinguishing them than hair color. If I thought everyone with brown hair had the same name, I would have problems. Are people with red hair any harder to distinguish than anyone else? I'll give you the answer: no. Also, all people with red hair are NOT related. It wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't happen so often. One time, my school pictures even got mixed up. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/14">(I got the pictures of a different red-headed kid in elementary school who I don't think was even in my class.)</span> It's like people see red hair &amp; their brains turn off.

						My Wikipedia article was declined. It's depressing. When I read the reason why, though, it sounded like they just didn't like me making up the name.

Their page is full of article declination complaints, &amp; I felt bad to be another, so I tried to make it nice. I told him (I hope I'm not messing up it's a him on someting that's going to be so public; the name is strange) that I don't care what the name is or how much the article is edited as long as it makes it. I haven't gotten a response, so there's still a small chance it might make it; I'm not getting my hopes up, though. Something interesting is, when I pulled up my article, it said it had been decined 12 seconds ago. That's weird.

						I got a response from the person who reviewed my Wikipedia article (their name is p42). He (?) said that if it's not a neologism (made up the name), then it's original research which isn't good either. I guess hours &amp; hours &amp; days &amp; days of work just spent on typing the article spread out over months has been wasted. It's <em>really</em> depressing. I suppose it's possible I may have said the same thing if I wasn't so personally attached to it, but that doesn't help much. I still want to make a website to publish original research.

						So, yesterday was Valentine's Day. I, of course, didn't have a valentine, but that doesn't matter to me too much. Besides, moving here over summer &amp; being shy doesn't exactly give me a head start. Apparently, there have been studies about Valentine's Day that say, to be the best valentine, you ought to wear red, carry a hot drink, &amp; speak into the person's right ear. Also, dark chocolate is best at first, but eventually, milk chocolate overtakes it. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/14">(Although, in my opinion, dark chocolate always wins.)</span> I don't understand some of that stuff, but oh well.

						There were these things called candygrams that people could buy at the school that would be given out during Academic Advisory. I was very surprised 2 days ago when I received one. Obviously, I was curious who would get me one, but I didn't have to wait long to find out. Since I don't have to change rooms, like most people do, to go to Academic Advisory, my teacher decided to give it to me before the previous class was over. <span class="p0">One of the people who sent it</span> saw me getting it &amp; said, "Oh, is that our valentine (might have said candygram)? We love you Robert!" Eventually, I read it, &amp; it said it was from p43, p44, &amp; p45 (people from my Odyssey class). At the bottom, underneath the typed print of "You're Awesome!!!!", was written, "Thanks for being such a good sport this year!" It had never seemed to me that anyone in that class (except slightly p38) payed very much attention to me at all. It still doesn't seem that way, but it gives me a new perspective. In the "To" part of the card was "Robert T. Benson". They got that from when, a long time ago, they saw a part on Wikipedia on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can_telephone">Tin can telephone</a> article that I added about making them go around corners. I had come up with the technique, so I put my name &amp; added the T so I wouldn't be confused with a Robert Benson already on Wikipedia. As you should already know, Wikipedia doesn't like original research, so it was almost completely deleted but not before they saw it. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">Extra information</span> Another ridiculous thing they say about my name is that it sounds like a fashion designer's name. Now, I wouldn't know what a fashion designer's name would sound like, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that my main profession is <em>not</em> going to be a fashion designer. That won't keep them from trying to convince me, though.

						Since Wikipedia has version control, you can still see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tin_can_telephone&diff=511668331&oldid=511570032">here</a> the section I added which was deleted. I say my section was "<em>almost</em> completely" deleted because, later on, a relatively small part was kept because I dug up a reference for a different (less effective) tactic. It seems that, during this beginning stage of my time on Wikipedia, I wasn't familiar enough with how changes were recorded to know how to see the history of changes and see the associated explanations. One of my big issues with my section being deleted was that "no explanation" was given, and I firmly expressed my discontent on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tin_can_telephone#Changes_made_to_this_article">the article's talk page</a> (a somewhat hidden part of every article meant for discussing the content). The people in Odyssey also read that, and <span class="person p44">one of them</span> said how they would go to me the next time they needed to write a strongly-worded letter. It turns out that there actually was a very brief edit description referencing unsourced original research, and I'm a little embarrassed now for so boldly referencing myself, but I was trying my best, and I had a somewhat different perspective of Wikipedia at the time. Also, it's quite a frustrating experience to know something you want to share, but you don't have any way of proving what you know (besides challenging people to try it themselves). This isn't as much of a problem for me anymore now that I can make websites easily, but you better have some solid references if you're going to put anything on Wikipedia. This isn't the end of my time on the Tin can telephone Wikipedia article, though.

						I'd say 13 hours is a new record for time slept by me. You can't sleep much longer without being in a coma. I think I've trained my body to sleep a long time on Saturday to make up for the sleep I don't get during the week. I had 3 dreams last night about catching mice.

						Yesterday, I put the finishing touches on my mouse trap. My parents have said how they're going to get something to catch the mice, but that won't happen for a very long time assuming it even does. I decided to take matters into my own hands &amp; used a bunch of popsickle sticks &amp; tape to create a mouse trap. It's a sort of box that has an opening on one end. I attached a "door" to the opening at the top &amp; had the bottom slanted inwards. This way, the mice could push in through the door, but when they tried to push out, the door would be stopped by the bottom, &amp; they couldn't get out. Yesterday, I put it all in a pretzel bag to disguise it &amp; baited it with a pretzel. I think the door was too hard to push in because the pretzel is still in there &amp; no mouse. I made the door a little easier for them to push in, so maybe I'll get a mouse tonight. Hopefully, the popsickle sticks are tough enough to not be nibbled through.

Moreover, I'm pretty sure I knew for a fact that at least one of the people who sent me the candygram definitely did have the same math teacher.

						Today has been our first snow day. If you'll notice the date, I'd consider this far too late to have our <em>first</em> snow day. P1 had me shovel a ridiculous amount. You would think that the amount of sleet that came along with the snow would make it good snow to make snowballs with, but it didn't. Among these random thoughts is the one that I should have done something fun in it. Maybe I didn't because I don't have anyone to do anything with. Maybe it's because I'd have to put on too many layers, &amp; I don't want to go through all that trouble. Maybe it's just because there isn't really that much to do anyway; I can't have a snowball fight (no people to have it with), I can't sled (my sled gets stuck in the snow because, as I recently thought of, I weigh more than when I was a little kid), I can't make an igloo (I wouldn't trust the mediocre snow), making a snow angel wouldn't keep me interested that long, &amp; I'm not sure how well a snowman would hold up. Most likely, I didn't do anything because of all those reasons combined. I don't think any one of those reasons would have deterred me.

						On a different note, my social studies teacher, p47, has her birthday today. She was saying how she would not be happy if we didn't have a snow day today. During class, she showed us a website that I think was called snow day calculator. You typed in a few things &amp; it would tell you how likely it is to have a snow day. Today was 99%. Tomorrow was 84%. We're having a snow day tomorrow, so I'd say that website is pretty good. Four-day weekend!

						Yesterday, a fairly important thing happened to me. A while ago, my Odyssey class wrote essays about "what giftedness means to a gifted student". I won 3<sup>rd</sup> place for highschool in the state. Whoever got 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> got to go to <span class="elaborate">Jefferson City</span> to be recognized. <aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Extra information" data-date="2023/11/15">The capital of Missouri</aside> The strange thing is, both 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> were also in my class: p48 &amp; p49. I was wondering how many people actually entered the contest, but the person coordinating the event said 250 people entered. If everyone was evenly distributed between elementary, middle, &amp; high school, there would be about 83 or 84 people competing. You can figure out the probability of the 3 highschool winners being in the same class if you're feeling ambitious. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection">I'm feeling ambitious.</span>
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection t13" data-heading="Nerding out" data-date="2023/11/15">
						To make the numbers a little easier to work with (and provide a more generous probability in the end), let's assume the participants were skewed a little towards the elementary and middle school categories and that there were only 80 entries in the high school category. There are over 550 school districts in Missouri, but they obviously didn't all enter. Let's assume that the average class size in the schools that entered was my class size (8) which would mean that 10 schools entered (&lt;2% of all schools in Missouri). (Actually, that assumption wouldn't matter, but it's interesting to gague what the participant pool might've been like.) The probability of any particular school having a winner (if there was only one) would be 8 in 80 (10%). However, since having a winner reduces the number of people left who can win, the probability of having a second winner would be 7 in 79, and a third would be 6 in 78. To get the probability of getting all 3 winners, you would need to multiply all of the probabilities (8/80 &times; 7/79 &times; 6/78) which would give <strong>a chance of about 0.068%</strong>. You could expect all 3 winners to come from the same high school <strong>only once every 1,471 times</strong> you held the essay contest (which would also be the number of years you'd have to wait for that outcome in a yearly essay contest). Note how the way I determined the probability of all 3 winners being from my class doesn't actually depend on how many schools entered or what their class sizes were, so this should be a fairly reliable probability; however, given such extremely slim odds, I can't help but second-guess my calculations and wonder how something like this could've been possible. Even if there were only 50 participants in high school, there would still only be a 0.29% chance. You would have to bring the participants down to 33 just to have a 1% chance. Also, although I don't think I would make that kind of mistake, if you went by strictly what was written here, you could interpret "250 people entered" to mean "250 people were in the high school category" which would bring the likelihood down to 0.0022%. Am I missing something here?

						Before anyone did much of anything, some people led us to watch Congress. The first thing they (&amp; we) did was pray &amp; say the Pledge of Allegiance. My immediate first thought was, "They aren't doing a very good job of separation of church &amp; state." They pray at the inauguration of the president too. It makes me wonder what goes through these people's heads when they decide to do this.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, after that, they started this extremely long, drawn-out, ridiculous process of introducing people including us. Also, even though they told us to turn off our phones &amp; don't bring any food or drinks, I saw the Congress people using their phones, &amp; they had all sorts of drinks. All of those people didn't even seem to be paying attention to whoever was talking. If that many people had side conversations in a classroom, the teacher's head would explode. I think I figured out why nothing gets done in Congress &amp; why everyone complains about them.

					<section>
						Once everyone got tired of listening to them, they took us back to the first floor. When we were there, they talked some &amp; started handing out awards. The awards were just pieces of paper. The first place people got an envelope as well that I think might have had a check. I don't think my essay was deserving of 3<sup>rd</sup> place. I ramble on about my life &amp; don't make much of a point. If I knew the essay was also supposed to promote gifted education (a part which the instructions left out), I think I could have made it better. To be fair to myself, the more I look at anything I did, the worse I think I did at it with <em>very</em> few exceptions. I still think I could have done better, though. p48 (who won first) said how she finds it hard to believe that her essay was best in the state, but I don't think it's that hard to believe.

They weren't even satisfied with me standing on the side; they made me go in between them. I didn't get second, so why do I have to stand in the middle? There were a few, more serious, pictures taken, &amp; then they wanted to take a goofy one. I'm not one for goofy photos, so I didn't really do anything, but both of them did.

					</section>
					<section>
						Before I go on, here is my view on the gifted program. I think that their heart is in the right place, but they're going about it the wrong way. For one thing, Odyssey is, by far, the least productive class out of any other. It's probably the nicest but definitely the least productive. People say how they like the challenge, but Odyssey isn't challenging. We skim over a variety of topics but never get in-depth enough to make it challenging. I think there ought to be advanced classes, so there will be a challenging class for whichever subject someone's good at. Also, I think they ought to do classes like they do in highschool earlier. People should be able to take classes based on their ability level. Anyway, that's my point of view.
					</section>
					<section>
						Back to the Capitol Building, there was some guide that led us to our representative &amp; senator. It turns out that our representative was Speaker of the House. There was a photographer apparently following him to take pictures. He seemed nice &amp; gave us pens. It was black &amp; said, "p50.firstName.string.toUpperCase p50.middleName.string.0. p50.lastName.string.toUpperCase SPEAKER" in golden print. Later, we found our senator, &amp; when he was told 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> were from his district, he said, "Of course, what did you expect?" He seemed nice as well.
					</section>
					<section>
						There wasn't much else to do after that, so we eventually left. Before we went very far, we found a place to eat. I'm not used to being given that much food. I still ate it all, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						During the drive back, we stopped at my grandparents' (on p2's side) house because they were on the way. We talked, &amp; they wanted to see my essay, but I didn't have it. I'm getting more &amp; more reluctant to let people read my essay because I keep thinking it's worse &amp; worse. I really don't think it's very good. At the very least, it's not very good compared to my standards for myself. After awhile, we left my grandparents' house &amp; went home. Pretty fascinating story, huh.

I realize they're just trying to be funny, but <em>everyone</em> tries to be funny in the same way. Besides, in that many seconds, it will still be my birth<em>day</em>. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/18">I also get complaints about how I'm calculating to midnight instead of the time of my birth, but besides the fact that it's easier to work with whole numbers of days, people would then change their mind and start complaining that I wasn't calculating to the beginning of the day, anyway. If I was born at 11:59pm, would my birthday only last one minute? I think not, so I'm calculating to midnight, and you all can just get over it.</span>

						Today, I was telling people that there's 604,800 seconds until my birthday, &amp; p51 decided she'd figure out when it was. She did it the hard way by going through minutes &amp; hours (like p19 did). The easier way is to know how many seconds are in a day (86,400). When I finally put in the effort to memorize it, there was so much less trouble. If you knew me &amp; thought it would have been cool to have your name published someplace but it's not in here, maybe you shouldn't have been so lazy &amp; figured out when my birthday is, so you could have been put in here. It's <em>really</em> pathetic that only 2 people in 4 years have figured out when my birthday is based on the seconds. I think my math teacher will figure it out when I see her tomorrow, but still, I shouldn't be able to keep track of each person who does it; it's not that hard to do. People are lazy.

						The third person to figure out when my birthday is was p38. I didn't have much time to bring up the seconds with my math teacher, so maybe she'll get it tomorrow. p38 figured out when my birthday is by hand (mostly). She didn't give a very good reason for not using a calculator, but she gave in when she had to figure out 120 &divide; 24.

						I think I overreact when people are nice to me. You wouldn't be able to tell, but when people compliment me or act interested in me, I end up really liking that person for that period of time. For a while now, I've been fooled into thinking that I'm liking the whole person in general rather than just the way they're treating me at the time. Of course, the way a person treats me at the time is a large part of who they are in general, but I've noticed that I don't like them nearly as strongly when they seem to not notice me much at all. If I liked the person in general, it wouldn't really matter if they were paying attention to me or not. I know it's hard to be convinced of the validity of this argument, but I guess the main point I'm trying to get across is that I have control of my emotions again.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't like the feeling that there is something about myself that I can't control. That includes my emotions. I don't like having a hard time deciding the right thing to do because my emotions are clouding my judgement. Sure, happy emotions are good, but I don't want to blindly do other things for them &amp; not be able to think it through. It's just the concept of me doing anything that I can't think through or control that I don't like. Keeping full control over my emotions &amp; actions, though, probably keeps me from letting loose a bunch of the time. P1 has compared me to a vulcan from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek"><i>Star Trek</i></a> &amp; a robot. I think those comparisons are pretty extreme, especially in the way he impersonates them, but I will admit that I am less emotional than most people. I have enough emotion to sympathize &amp; still feel things, but the rest is very mild.
					</section>
					<section>
						So anyway, I have rationalized yet another feeling &amp; now can control it. Even though I doubt this will be the last time this sort of thing happens, I am much more at ease knowing I can explain my emotions &amp; actions. Hopefully you haven't been too bored with me summarizing stuff I've said before in a rambling sort of way (which is about how I feel I made my essay that I got 3<sup>rd</sup> place on).

						IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!!! WHOO HOO!!!! There are now only 31,536,000 seconds until my birthday. Or 0 seconds, whichever you prefer.
					</section>
					<section class="t17">
						Each year, there are 3 times that I'm determined to stay happy during. One of those is Christmas. Another is for as long as possible during summer break. The last is, you guessed it, my birthday. I'd say I'm doing a fantastic job at it. I have so much more energy &amp; feel great. Being happy is awesome! Who would have thought? I'm not necessarily sad most of the time, but I'm not necessarily happy most of the time either, just sort-of indifferent. I almost feel like a different person with so much happiness. I've <em>really</em> pumped myself up for my birthday. I'm surprised there's that much in me.
					</section>
					<section>
						At the beginning of 1<sup>st</sup> hour, I received a happy birthday paper &amp; a Tootsie Pop from the principal like everyone does on their birthday. Two out of four classes sung happy birthday for me. Something I think is strange is how p52, whose birthday is the same as mine, didn't get as much attention for his birthday. He's had more time to get to know more people &amp; is more out-going, so why would he not get, at least, equally noticed? It happens with other people as well. Every once in awhile, I hear someone say, "Oh, it's your birthday today? Well, happy birthday!" And that's all there is to it.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't understand why, in the relatively small amount of time people notice me, people act like they've known me all their lives &amp; that we're best friends but don't do that for most other people. I've speculated before but come to no definate conclusion. Random people in the halls that I don't even know have done the same thing. I don't get it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Continuing on with my day, one person asked if I was getting my permit <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/21">since I was now 15</span>. No. I doubt if I will for a long time. A different thing that happened is p38, I think specifically because it was my birthday, decided it would be funny to try to tickle the back of my neck when everyone was leaving the lunch room. It was weird. Not much else happened at school.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I got home, I didn't expect anyone to get home for a very long time because there had been problems with a car &amp; my parents decided my birthday would be the perfect time to fix it. To my surprise, p2 showed up a lot earlier with some balloons. Once p1 finally got home, we ate chocolate cake &amp; Ice Cream Oreo Cake after I blew out the candles. There were 15 candles arranged in the shape of 15 (guess how old I am). I got one present with a few things in it. The main things were a black light in the shape of those curly fluorescent lightbulbs &amp; a mini FM radio. They're pretty cool. Birthdays are awesome!

						Yesterday, I made the most amazing igloo ever single-handedly. I mostly used snow from off the cars that p2 gave to me. It took me the whole day to make it, but in the end, I had a fairly roomy igloo that you could lay down in. My parents compared it to a cocoon &amp; a mud dauber nest. Usually, I don't agree with my parents' comparisons, but I have to admit that it looks a whole lot like that. While I was building my amazing igloo, p1 made an enormous snowman; it must be around 6 feet tall. He made a surprisingly good face to go along with it.

						Now would probably be a good time to mention it's spring. There has been more winter-like weather now than there was in winter, but the groundhog said it was going to be an early spring.
					</section>
					<section class="t15">
						That brings up another point. Groundhog's Day is the most ridiculous day there ever was. What genius put a <em>groundhog</em> in charge of saying what <em>season</em> it is! It makes no sense! Isn't it strange how everyone can tell when summer, fall, &amp; winter starts, but they need to ask a groundhog when spring starts. There's probably some sentimental reason behind it, but it's time to move on. It's just ridiculous.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection t15" data-date="2023/11/24">
						I found out within the next few years that the start of spring doesn't actually change depending on whether the groundhog sees its shadow. Groundhog Day is supposed to determine whether there are 6 more weeks of winter or whether there's an "early" spring, and ever since I started forming my own thoughts, I've thought it was one of the most ridiculous things in the world. To be clear, I always knew there was a spring equinox which <em>should</em> dictate the beginning of spring like the fall equinox does for fall, but I was under the impression that whoever does the relevant paperwork or whatever declares spring to start at a different time depending on whether the groundhog saw its shadow. I've complained about it to my friends, my parents, and even my teachers, and not once did anyone ever tell me that spring (officially) starts at the same time every year no matter what happens (presumably because they also didn't know or maybe they misunderstood me). Later on, I started wondering when, exactly, spring starts if it comes early since I started getting the impression that it wasn't immediately after Groundhog Day, and no one could tell me until, one day, I finally stumbled across <span class="person p53">someone</span> who had risen above the ignorance of society, and they told me how an "early" spring means there's "only" 6 more weeks of winter left whereas a "long" winter means there's a "whole" 6 more weeks of winter left. By the way, it was a friend of mine who told me this, not an adult. This obviously makes much more sense than that a large rodent is dictating our seasons, but society does plenty of other dumb stuff without explanation, so I don't consider something being dumb to be sufficient reason to think it's not true (regarding society, that is). I didn't have as much access to the internet at this time, so maybe I would've been able to clear this up sooner if I did, but even online, it's not obvious what's going on with Groundhog Day. I thought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Wikipedia article on Groundhog Day</a> mentioned how the start of spring doesn't actually change, but according to the current version, it's unclear at best. I could edit the Wikipedia article to be more clear, but I'm not sure how much more time I want to spend on this. I suppose you could make the argument that Groundhog Day is meant to predict the <em>start of spring-like weather</em> as opposed to the actual date spring commences, but I think that's an important distinction no one ever makes, and besides that, there are studies showing Punxsutawney Phil's predictions are extremely inaccurate. So there you go: If you, like me, didn't know that Groundhog Day had absolutely nothing to do with when spring begins, now you do, and you can shift your perspective from Groundhog Day being a dumb occasion to being a goofy and potentially misleading occasion.

						Today, I got my first phone. You're probably thinking, "You're just now getting your first phone!" I realize there are some 6-year-olds with phones, but I just never felt the dire need to have a phone. There just wasn't ever a time where I had to have a phone to talk to the masses of people lining up to learn more about my life. <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/11/24">Also, look at the date of this entry; cell phones weren't new, but you could only do so much with them without spending a whole lot of money (and even then, only so much), and my family had always been behind the times because we didn't have much money. What use do I have for something that I would only ever use to talk to my parents, take grainy photographs, and play a small selection of really pathetic games?</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						What brought up getting a phone was the trip the band is going on Wednesday. We're going to leave after school on Wednesday to Virginia &amp; come back on Sunday. Things would be a lot easier if I had my own phone for the trip. P1 said that he would get me a phone if I really wanted one but not if I just didn't want to use p2's phone on the trip. (They figured I needed a phone for the trip &amp; that I could use p2's which is ridiculous.) Eventually, I convinced myself that I'm tired of dealing with problems that could be solved with a phone, &amp; p1 began attempting to get a phone. At first, it seemed as if we had to get one mailed to us (to get <span class="elaborate">triple minutes</span>) &amp; that it would arrive too late, but then, out of the blue, p1 finds a triple minute phone at Walmart (which, apparently, aren't at Walmart very often), &amp; he buys it. There's still a few things that need to be worked out, but everything seems to be going fairly well.
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2023/11/29">
						Although it would've been possible to choose a reasonably sophisticated phone with some variety of unlimited plan like most people had, cost was a major consideration, so p1 was only really looking into cheap phones and plans like p2's (whereas p1's stuff was more expensive). P2 had a prepaid plan which required you to buy the minutes, texts, data, and service days ahead of time, and you would lose use of the phone when you ran out. With the service provider we were using (<a href="https://www.tracfone.com/home">TracFone</a>), it was possible to buy certain phones which would double or triple the number of minutes and stuff you got when you bought them. For example, if you bought the cheapest service bundle (for about $<span data-currency="USD">20</span>), you would ordinarily get 60 minutes, 60 texts, 60 megabytes of data, and 90 service days; however, if you had a triple-minutes phone, all of that (except for the service days) would be tripled (180 minutes, 180 texts, and 180 megabytes). It's obviously rather desirable to get three times the value for your money, so it's not very surprising that my parents wanted to take advantage of that, but you have to try harder to make sure you get that perk.

						Yesterday, we returned from our band trip to Virginia. There's a whole lot I want to say about it, &amp; you can be sure that I won't write this whole thing in just the date above.
					</section>
					<section>
						For our journey, we loaded up &amp; got in two, gigantic, red busses. The seats were like felt, one-person couches. There were also mini TVs scattered throughout the bus to watch movies. The windows were huge too with screens that came down to block some of the sun.
					</section>
					<section>
						I ended up in the second bus. We rode in the busses FOREVER. We went past the arch, through Illinois, through Indiana, &amp; through Kentucky. There was a few times where we stopped at rest stops. Kentucky was were we ran into problems.

						At about 3 in the morning, smoke started pouring out of the first bus. We had to pull off to a gas station. Once everyone decided there was no hope in sleeping, we got off the bus (also there's some weird rule about how passengers have to get off the bus while it's fueling up). It was funny watching 100-something kids overrun a gas station with one employee there. Eventually, they said they fixed it &amp; we could get back on. Isn't it strange then how we broke down again a few hours later in West Virginia. I'm not happy with just a few hours of sleep. Apparently, a hose on the bus broke &amp; they decided to try to fix it by stretching what was left of the hose to the other side. Eventually, the hose completely broke, &amp; we were left with this predicament. The 5 hours we were there while waiting to get the part replaced was mostly uneventful. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/25">I juggled some random stuff when I didn't think anyone was looking because I was bored.</span>

						There was one thing that stuck with me however. It's sad to see how the boys' line to the bathroom disappears almost instantly while the girls' line is enormous for a very long time. A few girls, though, decided it would be a great idea to go into the empty boy's bathroom, so they wouldn't have to wait. Just so you know my point of view on this, it is <span style="font-weight:bold"><em style="text-decoration:underline">NOT OKAY</em> TO USE THE OTHER GENDER'S BATHROOM UNLESS SOMEONE IS <em>DYING</em> AND THERE'S <em>NO ONE ELSE</em> AROUND!</span> It's amazing I didn't have nightmares for weeks afterwards.

						Once our 5 hours was up, we finally got back on the road. The Appalachian Mountains are cool. I can only imagine what the Rocky Mountains or something even bigger would be like.

					</section>
					<section>
						There wasn't much to do once everyone was in their rooms, so the other people in my room started a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)">Mau</a> (assuming that's how you spell it) &amp; invited me to play. It's a card game with strange rules loosely based off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">Uno</a>. Every time you break a rule you get another card, &amp; one of the rules is to not talk about the rules. When someone wins a round, they get to make up a new rule for the next round. The rules always begin the same, so it takes a while to get interesting. My version of this game would be that everyone starts off making a rule that has no exceptions. When someone wins, they get to make up their own rule. The only other fundemental rules would be: everyone starts with the same amount of cards, you can only lay down one card at a time, fines can be only one card per rule, &amp; you want to get rid of all your cards. You could also make it so you <em>don't</em> want to lose your cards which would be an interesting way to mix it up.

						It was <em>really</em> disgusting. I could go into great detail, but no one wants to hear that. The only thing I'll say is that throwing up is <strong>NOT</strong> the way I wanted to be reminded that my sinuses are connected to my mouth. I hadn't thrown up in years &amp; years, so I was wondering what could have caused it. Someone in my hotel room said they thought it was from me eating the salad at Cici's Pizza. I couldn't be sure, but now I'm going to be scared of their salad. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/11/29">My parents suggested that I threw up because I was nervous about being away from home, but I can say with absolute certainty that that was <em>not</em> the explanation.

						The next day, I was feeling better but wasn't going to push it. The awards ceremony for Music in the Parks was being held at <a href="https://buschgardens.com/williamsburg/">Busch Gardens</a>, an amusement park in the setting of villages with various scenery. I have never really been a fan of rollercoasters because I don't like feeling like I'm going to die. Before I rode one, I thought they were really cool. I don't like being scared of something enjoyed by so many people, so I was planning on riding a few of the less extreme rollercoasters to try to get over it. Being sick the night before ruined all of that. I could feel myself getting worse as I walked around instead of resting. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2023/11/29">Side story</span> When we finally made our way to the awards ceremony, we found out we got second, but it looked like there was no more than 10 schools there.

When it got cold, she took me to someplace inside. I'm glad I slept because I felt a whole lot better but not healed. Eventually everyone went back to the hotel.

					<aside class="reflection t11" data-heading="Side story" data-date="2023/11/29">
						Unrelated to how sick I was, there was something I found particularly interesting as I shuffled around with my group. <span class="person p54">One of the people</span> in my group (who was also a French Horn player) had <span class="person p55">a younger sister</span> who was also in the band. At one point, we met up with her and <span class="person p71">one of her friends</span> (I think it was only one), and we walked around with them for a while until they decided they wanted to go elsewhere. Later on, we met up with them again except, this time, they weren't alone: They each were holding onto a guy. These guys definitely weren't in the band, and they looked a fair bit older than them (although I'm terrible at gauging age). I felt like I missed something because I couldn't believe it, but I'm pretty sure they had just met the guys in the time they had been separated from us. They were holding hands and kissing, and I was having a hard time understanding how something like this could happen. <span class="person p55">The one girl</span>'s <span class="person p54">brother</span> didn't seem to have a high opinion of his sister's moral character. It was pretty crazy.

						The next morning, we loaded up the busses &amp; left for home. I slept most of the way there (I didn't before). As we approached the high school (where we left from), I noticed that previously dormant trees were budding.
					</section>
					<section>
						After my constantly late parents arrived, they picked me up, &amp; my journey was over. Of course they didn't take me home first; we went to some store. On the bright side, there were some Easter eggs with candy in them left over from an Easter egg hunt they held a week ago that I found &amp; got to keep. In addition, it turns out that my parents got high-speed internet &amp; Wi-Fi while I was gone. Also, I got a "WELCOME BACK" balloon. What an experience!

I bet there would be enough people interested to have a German <em>club</em>. And so the idea of German club came about. Who would teach German club if there's no one at the school left who knows it well enough you ask? Me. I am one of the few people who have the ability to learn a language &amp; understand it quickly enough to be able to teach it after only a summer of learning. Besides, I would only be teaching basic German the first year, so I'm not having doubts that I'll be able to pull it off. <span class="t18">I'm awesome at languages</span> as anyone in my Spanish class could tell you. I've been coming up with plans for what to do, but a big problem is that I don't know how many people will join. I guess I'll just have to figure it out when next year starts.

						Something I didn't like about a German club, though, is that no one got a German credit for it. I asked <span class="person p56">the principal</span> about it, &amp; he gave vague suggestions, but I wasn't too sure if I would be able to get people credit for it. However, when he talked about the online, summer German course, he said there would be credit for it! <span class="t7">I am <em>so</em> lucky that I was in band &amp; had to play for graduation.</span> Graduation is just after summer break starts, &amp; if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have known about the course until next school year. I'm wondering if people will be less inclined to be in a German club if they can take it over summer, but I think there will be at least some people who won't take the effort to go online without having the advantage of already knowing German or want to have a classroom experience which can tend to some needs that a computer can't.

						There are probably many people that doubt my teaching ability because of how shy I am. Something most people don't realize is that I'm capable of acting like I have no problem talking to people I don't know very well if I have good enough reason. Good reason would include selling things, explaining things, &amp; leading people, among other things. Teaching would fall under the category of explaining things. I'm going to make this German club work, &amp; <span class="t1">as I've said before, when I say something's happening, it's happening</span>.

					<section>
						In case you haven't noticed, I've probably talked about p38 more than anyone else in here other than me. That's because I like her more than I want to admit.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing I want to make perfectly clear before I go on is I would <em>never NEVER</em> tell <em>anyone</em> any of this directly. As for why I'm writing it in here, I don't have the best reasoning. Deep, deep, <em>deep</em> down, I want to talk about this sort of stuff, but I could make it without venting. I guess it doesn't seem so awkward when I'm writing with no one knowing my thoughts, but I know good &amp; well that this is going to get published. The point is, this isn't one of my more thought-out entries.
					</section>
					<section>
						I've been trying to delay writing about this until summer which I've obviously accomplished. I almost gave in &amp; wrote about it earlier, but then I remembered about the awesome igloo I made &amp; decided to write about that instead. My reasoning for waiting until summer to write about this is just about as good as my reasoning to write about this at all; I'm not exactly sure why. Although I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this, I'm going to continue. Consider yourself lucky because, once again, I would <em>NEVER</em> tell you this in person or otherwise.
					</section>
					<section>
						From the beginning, I liked how she was nice to me, but I wasn't going to be swayed that easily. However, over time of consistently being nice to me, it started to wear me down. I think if I had more close friends, someone being nice to me wouldn't be such a big deal. I doubt p38 was treating me special very much except for trying to make me feel included because she knew I was alone often. Ordinarily, I may try to timidly convince myself that I should maybe think about going along with my emotions, but she has a <span class="person p39">boyfriend</span> (the same one I mentioned before), &amp; I'm not going to get in the way of any sort of a relationship unless it's borderline abusive. Besides, I think he's better suited for her than I would be; he's much more out-going &amp; openly affectionate. Also, he seems pretty nice although I don't know him well. I have spent the majority of second semester trying to get her out of my head. I feel bad to even think about anything with her in it because she has a boyfriend. Probably something like 90% of all internal struggles about liking people I've written in here are related to her in some way.
					</section>
					<section class="t16">
						If only it was easier to think of her as just a friend; I bet she would be a pretty good one. Towards the end of school, though, she had started to pay less attention to me, so it <em>did</em> become easier for me. I have guesses as to why she started paying less attention to me, but the evidence to support them is nearly non-existent. When I think about how p38 treated me, I know it was only how a nice friend would treat me which makes me wonder if I'm going to be able to have nice friends (that are girls anyway). I've thought for a while that, if I got a girlfriend (which would be a serious commitment for me), I would be able to focus all of these sorts of emotions on her &amp; so eliminate all problems of liking anyone too much, but I have yet to test this theory, &amp; I don't see that changing in the near future.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't want to have to eliminate half of all my potential good friends. In addition, girls seem to actually want to talk to me somewhat as opposed to just I'm there so they might as well talk to me. I'm not saying all boys fit into that 2<sup>nd</sup> category (&amp; I would like to think that I don't most of the time), but I think it's safe to assume that more boys do than girls. I know it's not meant in a mean way, but that's the sort of feeling I get. I wonder, though, if it would be the opposite if I were a girl.
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Contrary to popular belief, I like talking to people &amp; am lonely all the time. I think that people are under the impression that I like to be alone with my thoughts because I'm such a quiet person. Let me clear this up once &amp; for all: that is not true what so ever. There are very very few times that I would ever not want to talk to anyone about anything unless I hated their guts which is also very very unlikely. I am NOT one of those people always searching for peace &amp; quiet. You may think that I might take this back if I started to talk to a bunch of people, but I wouldn't be too confident about that. I'm very good at imagining scenarios &amp; coming to an objective conclusion. Sure there would be times that I got tired of being unproductive of got just plain tired, so I would force myself to end the conversation, but I would still <em>want</em> to talk. If you ever think that I'm getting tired of listening to you talk, you're WRONG! The only times it may be true are if you're trying to get me angry or bore me to death, both of which are pretty hard to do.
					</section>
					<section class="t16">
						Liking being talked to doesn't help when girls like to talk. What scares me the most is how I sense the same thing that I'm going through about p38 beginning to happen with other people. There are other people that are nice to me that I haven't been around as much that I just know will go down the same path unless I can find a way to change how I think about it. I'm really hoping I can keep this from happening; it takes a lot out of me to be so worried &amp; conflicted especially over something so ridiculous.
					</section>
					<section>
						I've wondered how p38 will react to this entry when she reads it. I know she'll read it because who doesn't want to read an autobiography about someone they used to know who even became famous? Her response will probably be somewhere along the lines of surprised, sad that it's caused me so much trouble, &amp; maybe a little awkward. However, if she somehow got a hold of this now (which is so extremely unlikely that it's hardly worth mentioning because there's no way I would <em>ever</em> let anyone get to this until it's published, &amp; I know how to keep things a secret), I suspect there would be a whole lot more awkwardness going around.
					</section>
					<section>
						Up until this point, my fears of what would happen if someone found this were unjustified; it wouldn't be the most comfortable thing in the world, but there wasn't much anyone could do to me over the facts &amp; opinions written. Now, I can only imagine the horrors that would ensue.
					</section>
					<section>
						People seem to think of me like I'm not real in the sense of they can only imagine me as someone who only works on school work, does geeky stuff in their free-time (which I do but not as ridiculous as they make it out to be), follows the rules exactly, &amp; has non-existent emotions. Anything that conflicts with this unrealistic view comes across as thrilling. Since there aren't many times when people see me go against this view, it continues to be exciting for them. I don't have a problem with people seeing me this way because it allows me to stay being the quiet person that I am &amp; yet people keep talking to me to see if there's something they can dig up that challenges how they think of me. I think something else that lets this continue is that, although I'm quiet, I'm not so quiet that I'm unapproachable. This isn't the only reason people talk to me, but it's a major one. Luckily, no one is mean about it or pries, but I would have to be pretty oblivious to not know what they're trying to do. There are people who would do anything to get a hold of this because of how I pour myself out into it &amp; especially because of an entry as juicy as this.
					</section>
					<section>
						You may wonder why I'm writing this entry &amp; going to publish it if I'm so scared of people reading it. In case you weren't paying attention at the beginning of this, I'm not really sure. I'm not the most comfortable doing things without solid reasoning, but as I continue thinking about why I would do this, I can only come up with that I just want to get it out. Not being forced to directly speak to someone about it puts me at enough ease that I don't feel the need to suppress stuff (which I'm very good at) when I'm writing in here. Something like 80% of every single thing I do (counting when I'm at home) is based off of what I think others might think about me. The main reason that 20% even exists is because I'm left alone often. My conformity decreases with an increasing seriousness of a matter, but a large majority of my life is still governed by my ridiculous fears of the thoughts of others.
					</section>
					<section>
						One person I'm particularly scared of finding this is p1. Not even p38 is at the top of my fearful of this being found by list even if it was relatively likely that she would find it. P1 would want to talk all about it &amp; he would force me to participate. Also, this journal could never be secret again because he would probably want to be updated on what I'm writing in here which could also cause me to not write everything I feel. Of course, I can't be sure of all of this, &amp; p1 would tell you he would hardly do any of that, but I don't think I'm too far off. I realize it may not be the best idea to say that in here when I know he's going to read this eventually, but if goes back to my reasoning of just wanting to get it out, &amp; hopefully, by the time p1 reads this, it will be so long ago that he doesn't care for parts that apply &amp; since I'll be moved out, he won't want to waste much time talking about this. <span class="h-u2">It will stink if it doesn't end up this way.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						People finding this journal isn't the only thing I'm afraid of. I'm pretty sure that there's something between a 25-50% chance that I'll end up in the same math class as p38. As more time goes by, it gets harder for me to tell if it's getting easier for me to deal with all of this becase I'm convincing myself to not think so ridiculously of if it's because there's more time separating me from it which wouldn't prevent it from happening again when I go back to school. I'm actually thinking it's the second option, but I'm desperately hoping I'm making a wrong assumption. It will be such a shame to not be able to enjoy p38 being nice if I end up in the same math class as her. I wish that, when I come to the conclusion that something is ridiculous or pointless, I could purge my mind of all my thoughts of that ridiculous or pointless thing.
					</section>
					<section class="t12">
						One thing I'm glad for, though, is that I can keep this all on the inside. I would hardly ever have a carefree thought again throughout my entire high school career if people could tell this is what I think. It would be unbearably awkward, &amp; the only thing that can never be beat out by awkwardness for things I want to avoid is death. The only thing that can beat out death is more death, so I'd say awkwardness is a major thing I want to prevent. What makes it even worse is that I always make myself feel bad for feeling awkward because I think I'm overreacting (which I usually am. It's extremely easy to make me feel awkward, but I don't think it shows through unless you know when &amp; how to look for it). So not only do I feel awkward, but I also feel bad for feeling awkward. It's not fun.
					</section>
					<section>
						At this point, unless you're one of the people who know me, you're probably getting tired of me going on &amp; on about stuff I feel, so you'll be happy to know I'm running out of things to say. You can be sure that I'll tell you the results when I go back to school, but I don't know what else I could possibly add, &amp; besides, even I'm getting tired of writing about this. Hopefully everything works out.

						I'm about to kill the people running the website that gives me a German credit.
					</section>
					<section>
						For awhile, there has been turmoil in the German class. Most of the problems arose from trying to fit 180 lessons into less than 60 days over the summer. At first I thought I would have to fit 360 lessons into less than 60 days, but <span class="person p57">one of the people keeping track of me</span> (called p57.extra1) told me that the lessons aren't given out one session at a time (there are 2) like a normal person would do, &amp; instead, all the lessons are given out at once &amp; generally need to be finished by the end of session 2. (I'm getting to that generally part.) With that said, I figured I had to do just under 4 lessons a day to get finished by the end. That's just enough lessons in a day to have it be possible to finish them but use up the majority of the day doing so. I could go 2 or 3 times faster than I do, but I retain more of it when I go slower, &amp; when I take the extra time to go more in-depth about something, I understand it so much better &amp; don't slow down every time I see it because I don't know why it's like that. Back to the generally by the end of session 2, there is apparently a cutoff to session 1 where I have to finish the first of 4 parts which was today.
					</section>
					<section>
						Now it's time to get into why I'm about to kill the people running the website that gives me a German credit. After getting past the initial problems, p57.extra1 would continue to call me some days to see if everything was alright. I'm not sure if she does that with everyone, but I wouldn't be too surprised if she did. Not too long ago, she called &amp; said session 1 would be ending on Friday (today). It's a good thing she told me that or else <span class="e-o2">I would have ridiculously thought that it would end on the date plainly stated for all to see on website that I registered on (30<sup>th</sup>).</span> I guess they just pick whatever weekday is closest without going over. Anyway, I have to battle p1 for the only working computer, so it's hard to get work done. The deadline was approaching, &amp; I thought (&amp; planned that) I would get done early, but battling p1 made sure that I wouldn't be able to breeze by anything. Also, we had to go places which ate away at time. Yesterday, I didn't get to the computer until fairly late, but I was determined to finish Part 1 (the part I would be graded on out of 4) that day &amp; certainly before the 11:00am (the am was inferred) cutoff today. To put a stop to those hopes, the people running the website decided it would be a great time to shut the website down for maintenance. They tell you an hour beforehand, but I would prefer them to tell us at least at the beginning of the day it's going to happen which could have averted the tragic ending to this story. I tried to whiz by the last few lessons but was stopped before I could get to the unit test, the big end-of-part exam, &amp; the small course survey. Although I was frustrated at not being able to finish, I didn't get too upset because I still had today until 11:00am. I planned on getting up early (before noon) to give me some extra time, but I'll admit that didn't go exactly as planned. Nonetheless, I still had time left, &amp; I went to work on the unit test. Almost all the questions on all the tests are multiple choice &amp; what isn't, isn't too long which is why I wasn't too intimidated. I finished the unit test just after 11 &amp; sent it in. It wasn't really specified what would happen if I sent stuff from Part 1 in after 11, so I just assumed there was a cutoff for Session 1 so the teachers (which don't really teach) could put together something like a progress report. Surely I would have been told if something bad would happen.
					</section>
					<section>
						<del>In the meantime</del> <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/1/20">While finishing up the part</span>, I was determined to get everything done right then &amp; there. I didn't get up for <em>anything</em>; not to eat, not to go to the bathroom, not to get a drink or stretch. Nothing. The only time I got up was to answer the home phone when p1 called, &amp; then I went right back to work. This was particularly noticeable when I got to the end-of-part exam. I had no idea they would ask me to type a huge research report on a famous German person (in English). I slaved away at that thing for hours upon hours, once again, not getting up for anything. In the end, I had a 4-paragraph report finished on Albert Einstein. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/1/20">(Yes, it does take me hours upon hours of nonstop work for me to finish a 4-paragraph research report.)</span> While thinking that it was ridiculous how I had to finish something that normally takes at least a week in one day, I was relieved it was finally over &amp; approached the button to re-enter the test to attach the Word document as I anticipated the short course review &amp; then freedom. Once I clicked on the button, my greatest horror was realized. A small box appeared in the middle of the screen stating that the grades have already been entered &amp; can no longer be altered... (This is me letting it sink in.) ...
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2024/1/20">
						Having since experienced much worse situations and gotten used to expecting things online to shut off immediately at the deadline, these events don't seems nearly as shocking and infuriating to me now as they did at the time, but in my defence, I'm pretty sure this was the first time I had ever needed to turn in anything online, and I even may not have ever experienced late work not being accepted. I remember thinking how strange it was that something could be turned in for full credit at one moment but then not even accepted just one second later. I grew up at a time when it was a reasonable question to ask the class if they had internet access, and although that time was passing by the time I started going to high school, you can see by how I was competing with p1 for the only computer that my family was slow to move into the internet age, so I wasn't very familiar with the standards of that age. Also, that online course legitimately did have a lot of problems that weren't at all related to my familiarity with online courses (as I soon state), so let's not pretend like the source of all of the issues was from me.
					</section>
					<section>
						I can't believe they did this to me! I clicked the button a few more times not knowing what else to do; I was wondering why the grade they show on the home screen dropped from a 96% to an 87%. It would be one thing if no one ever called me from the website headquarters, &amp; I had to figure this out one my own, but the fact that someone did &amp; didn't tell me what would happen makes it all the worse. There are so many things I could have been told to avert this scenario:
					</section>
					<ol>
						<li>You get a zero on all stuff not finished.</li>
						<li>The end-of-part exam is a gigantic research report that normally takes a week to finish.</li>
						<li>The website is going to shut down for maintenance the day before the end of Session 1, so hurry up.</li>
					</ol>
					<section>
						If I was told <em style="text-decoration:underline">any</em> of this, this whole crisis could have been avoided. In addition, if I was at least notified when it was too late, I could have been working on lessons in the next part or doing frivolous things such as eating, going to the bathroom, or moving more than 2 inches in my chair.
					</section>
					<section class="t6 t23">
						Also, I don't know if they add grades to my permanent record each semester like they do here. (The website is based in a different state.) Now that we moved to this school district, I don't have nearly as many problems with homework, &amp; because of that, my grades went up. I got a 4.0 grade point average which I never thought I could get last year. Since 9<sup>th</sup> grade is the first grade where stuff really sticks with you, I got here just in time to get an untainted 4.0. If that unfair B is added to my grade point average, I will never be able to get it higher than something like 3.9 unless I take weighted courses. I will <em style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</em> let that happen. <span class="t1">Remember how I said that if I say something is happening, it's happening? This is one of those scenarios.</span> If that grade brings my GPA down, they are going to have to answer to me. I am a very mild person all the time, but don't you get in my way when I'm that passionate about something. I was really proud of myself for getting ranked top in my class (people can be tied for first), &amp; <em>no one</em> is going to take that away from me unless it's my fault which this doesn't qualify as.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although I was at first wondering if an exception should really be made, I think they ought to at least let me turn in the report that is <em>already finished</em>. If I would get a score of at least 34/90 (which is a horrible F) my grade would be brought back up to an A. Now that I know all this ridiculous stuff is going to happen next time, it's not like I'm going to let it happen again. Surely making one exception for something that wasn't my fault wouldn't be that big of a deal. I have <em>NEVER</em> come across a website with this many problems. Ever. That's not an exaggeration. There are typos everywhere, a bunch of the details of what's being taught is somewhat inconsistent or explained badly, the questions are worded in the worst way possible on the tests assuming you can tell it's a question, &amp; there are a bunch of questions that just plain have the wrong answer (if you could understand the question). I can deal with <em>all</em> of this, but once you start messing with my grade like that, that's where I draw the line. I'm going to make a reign of terror if my GPA is affected. <span class="person p57">My advisor</span> is supposed to call me the Monday after this coming one. You can be sure she's going to hear about all of this.

That's <em>really</em> pushing the limits of what I can accomplish in one day. German all day every day doesn't hold much appeal. If I didn't really want a full credit of German, I don't think I could go on. I'm hoping I can keep it together for the last 21 days.

						In less serious news, last night wasn't the most comfortable of nights. I couldn't fall asleep for awhile, so I was in bed still aware of my surroundings. Eventually I started feeling a tingling on my foot. Naturally, I assumed it was due to me barely touching the edge of my covers which are at the end of my bed because it's too hot. I knew that if I touched more of my covers it wouldn't feel so weird, so I started moving my foot around to find them. Once I started moving my foot, it seemed to me that the tingling didn't move quite like sheets did, &amp; about the same time as I touched the <em>real</em> edge of my sheets is when I realized the bug-like nature of what was on top of me. I frantically shook my foot to get whatever was on me off which was when I discovered it had some weight to it. Luckily, I got it off, &amp; <span class="h-o2">when I landed from jumping 10 feet into the air</span>, I turned on the light to see what it was. What do I see on the edge of my bed but a cricket. I was glad it wasn't a giant spider, but it was still creepy. After a moment of hesitation, I decided to try to take it outside, but it got away. I don't know what would possess a cricket to go through all of that trouble to get on my bed just to freak me out. Although not much else happened, I think it's needless to say that I didn't get to sleep too easily after that.

						The torture is finally over! Technically, it was over at 3pm on Wednesday, but I hadn't gotten around to this until now.
					</section>
					<section>
						After all the pain &amp; suffering, I managed to get a half of a German credit. Why only half you ask? Because, although I did more than half, I didn't get the rest finished. Fitting a year-long class into 2 months is difficult especially under these circumstances. To give you a better idea of how hard it is, let me tell you those circumstances. Since I've already gone through a year of Spanish, it will be easiest to compare to that. There are 180 "daily" lessons in the course. There are only 174 school days in a year, &amp; there are some early release days in that. The reason they are called "daily" lessons is because normal people take the course during the school year. That version isn't sponsored for us. On top of there only being 174 school days instead of 180, I don't even have Spanish every day. The class ends up being longer, but we don't do more than a lesson's worth. In addition, we were never assigned gigantic writing assignments. Now imagine all of that extra work we don't do crunched into a little less than 2 months. But that's not all. As I have said before, there was a bunch of wrong &amp; inconsistent stuff in the course. Also, in the beginning, I tried to memorize each word &amp; the things that go along with them which took more time than nearly skimming. <span class="e-o2">How silly of me.</span> Along with all of that, I had to try to get through p1 to get to get to the computer which is nearly impossible. When the other computer was finally fixed, it decided it hadn't tortured me enough &amp; slowly began to work less &amp; less. <span class="t7">Once the 2 weeks worth of band camp which lasts 6 hours started (I'll talk about band camp later), I had an especially difficult time completing the necessary lessons.</span> As you can imagine, I don't have thoughts of German every waking moment which also didn't help me do the German class every waking moment like I needed to. Although I really wanted a full German credit, the universe was obviously determined to keep it from happening, so I only got half.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						For the record, I got over 75% of the course finished, but there were holes in what I did (not every assignment for every lesson was finished), &amp; this school district only does grades by semester ... I think. I say I think because of the ridiculous confusion surrounding this course. The person I'm supposed to talk to about it is <span class="p0">my counselor</span>. The problem is, they don't even know that an online summer course exists until I tell them. When I finally get to ask them the question I went there to ask (in the few times I'm able to come in contact with my changing counselors), they say I should consult Grandview (the school district I register through). Counterdictory to that, p57.extra1 said Grandview has nothing to do with it &amp; only sends a transcript to my district. If my school district is supposed to be the one in charge of this stuff &amp; yet they're telling me someone else is, something's telling me I'm not going to get many answers. <span class="p0">My counselor</span> said that I definitely can't get &#190; of a credit, but said I need to ask Grandview if I get any credit at all since it's an online course. These people are going to drive me crazy. I better get half of a credit.
					</section>
					<section>
						I hope things are smoother next year (yes, I plan to do it again. How else am I going to get credit for a class not taught?), but I just know they won't. There are certain things that they seemed confident in answering, but I just know are going to fall apart next year. All I can do is hope for the best. At least now I get to relax &amp; have fun (until school starts in less than 2 weeks).

					<section>
						On Sunday, we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meramec_Caverns">Meramec Caverns</a>. You may ask, "If you went to Meramec Caverns on Sunday, why didn't you write about it then?" That's a reasonable question. Other than just not getting around to it, it's also due to the fact that most entries of much length at all take more than one day to write. I can't start another entry if I haven't finished the last one can I? There are other things I like to do more than write in this, &amp; I avoid writing in this while my parents are around because I'd prefer that no one know about this until it's published. The only one I think even notices I write in here is p2 increasingly rarely, &amp; she thinks I'm writing a story. I like writing stories too, but I can't possibly do everything at once. So anyway, that's what's going on.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="display-left" src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Meramec Caverns %2301.jpg" style="width:14em">
						Meramec Caverns was cool. I thought 60&deg;F would be cold in summer, but it wasn't; I ended up regretting bringing a jacket I had to carry around with me the whole time. For a long time, we just walked around in uninteresting tunnels which the tour guide said were made of dolomite. The tour guide turned off lights behind us, so you couldn't be too slow. Eventually we got to interesting stalactites &amp; stalagmites in a low-ceilinged room behind a glass barrier. The path stopped before we went too far into the cave, &amp; when we turned around, we took a different path which had better sights. We were told some animals lived further down. They probably didn't want us to disturb them. So unfair. Going through the tunnels, I saw moss growing on rocks right next to a light. It was funny.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img class="display-right" src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/scenes/Stalactites (R).jpg" style="width:14em">
						There are only so many words to describe cave rock formations. Some were long &amp; fat, &amp; some were short &amp; skinny. Some were high on the ceiling, &amp; some you almost had to duck to miss. There was water in a bunch of places, &amp; stalagmites came up from a few of them. At one formation, different colored lights were shown on the rocks. One room used to have water in it &amp; below that water level, there were a bunch of spherical rocks attached to each other. They called it the wine room (one of the reasons being because of the "grapes"). There was also a rock formation towards the middle of the room with 3, small columns holding up another grape-like structure that went flat at the previous water level &amp; had 3, small stalagmites sticking up from it. In the last room, there were a bunch of long stalactites making up their own wall. They had a big lightshow on it while music was playing, &amp; at the end, they showed an image of the United States flag. The tour was over after that, &amp; we were walked back.
					</section>
					<section>
						Our day wasn't over after that, though. Within the area around Meramec Caverns is something called the <a href="https://www.cavemanzipline.com/">Caveman Zipline</a>. P2 was against going to it because of the cost, but p1 really, really wanted to go. Eventually we went to it &amp; had to sign, among other things, a gigantic agreement basically saying that, yes, we're healthy enough to do this, &amp; if we die or something, it's not their fault (we didn't die). We had to take a short course to make sure we knew what we were doing. After that, we started walking up a gigantic tower to get to the zipline.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						As I looked out at the really long zipline far above the parking lot &amp; Meramec River going into the woods, I felt my fear of heights setting in. I've been getting better at hiding things that scare me, but I still wasn't looking forward to it. When it was finally time for me to go, I did everything I could to not think about what was going on &amp; just focused on the cable keeping me from falling to my death. On the other side, there were a few other smaller ziplines, &amp; the zipline going back was longer than the first one. I managed to keep my cool all the way through.
					</section>
					<section class="t3 t10">
						At the end of the last zipline, there was a photographer to get a picture of people's expressions. My expression was very blank because of trying to push down my fear; p1 wasn't happy about it. If there's one thing p1 dislikes about me more than anything other than me not immediately doing exactly what he says without question is being shy &amp; keeping things to myself. It's really sad because I'd consider that to be my dominant personality trait. He was telling me how bad I was for trying to hide how much "fun" I was having like I always do. If the conversation had continued long enough, I would have told him I didn't look thrilled because I was scared to death but it didn't. I don't like being scared of anything, &amp; maybe when I'm on my own, I'll do the things that scare me a whole lot to get over it but that doesn't change things now. <span class="t23">I know I conceal my emotions a lot, but that's because I'm scared of not giving the perfect reaction or impression which portrays exactly the right thing;</span> I shouldn't be told off for it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, that was the end of our time at Meramec Caverns. It was a full day.

					<section>
						So I'm back at school. Technically, school started on August 14, but I haven't gotten around to this entry until now. Besides, now I can give a better overview instead of my first impressions. This is going to be a long one, so get ready.
					</section>
					<section>
						I'll begin with the bus. This year, I can tell how old everyone is that's younger than me. Before, I couldn't tell whether someone was in 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> grade, but now, everyone who was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade goes to Riverbend which is only for 8<sup>th</sup> graders, &amp; everyone who was in 6<sup>th</sup> stayed at the middle school. There are only 2 people that go to Riverbend in the morning now &amp; only 3 on the way back. For at least one day, I want them to be gone, so we can skip Riverbend altogether. There are tons of new 6<sup>th</sup> graders. Although only one new stop was added, 6<sup>th</sup> graders must make up almost half of the bus. I don't know how something like that happens.
					</section>
					<section>
						As I said before, I'll tell you about the pointless internal struggle regarding p38. This year, I don't have any classes with her, so I only see her in the halls &amp; at lunch every once in a while. I can tell that not coming in much contact with her is causing any ridiculous thoughts to go away, even since the beginning of the school year. For awhile, I had a whole bunch to say on this topic, but I find myself with not as much anymore because it's going away.
					</section>
					<section class="t14">
						I need more friends. I don't think I'd have these problems if I did. When we moved school districts going into middle school, I'm certain I had a decent amount of friends by the 2<sup>nd</sup> year. I don't remember that period of time well enough to tell what I did to make that happen, but I know I was more out-going then. Being less quiet to attract more friends would help prevent me from clinging so much (internally) to the people that are nice &amp; try to break me out of my very thick shell. <span class="t29">I don't think it would <em>completely</em> solve things <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/2/28">regarding my attachment to girls</span> because I'm realistic, &amp; since I've been getting older, it stands to reason that hormones are playing a role in this although I <em>seriously</em> doubt that it's the only factor or even the dominant factor.</span> <span class="t23">I hope whoever I end up being with in the future is okay with me having had a ridiculous response to someone who just tried to make me feel comfortable.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t24">
						In other news, you may be wondering about what happened with the German club. That dream has been crushed. At first everything seemed to be going great; I was getting things planned out, I ended up getting <span class="person p58">one of my sponsors</span> as my Academic Advisory teacher even though I don't have them as a regular teacher, I had recruited <span class="p0">a 3<sup>rd</sup> sponsor</span> for the club, &amp; to top it off, <span class="person p59">an exchange student from Germany</span> ended up in <span class="person p60">my previous Spanish teacher</span>'s class (one of my sponsors). What could have gone wrong you ask? Well, circumstances that made me doubt how often the club could meet caused me to ask p56.extra1 that question, &amp; his response was once a month. The club was destroyed right then &amp; there. I held off making it official, hoping for a miracle, but it never came. I was told the club could meet any time before of after school instead of during Academic Advisory, but my parents can't really drive me many places, &amp; my bus arrives kind-of late &amp; leaves early. I know I also said this was happening too, but I assure you, these failures with that sort of determination are exceptions, not the rule.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although the German club proved to be a waste of time, I still thought it would be interesting to meet the German exchange student because I hadn't &amp; wouldn't since there wasn't going to be a German club. It's not every day that you can meet someone from another country &amp; can help you learn another language. I told p60 (my previous Spanish teacher) about it, &amp; she wanted to bring the person over during class so she wouldn't forget, but I pushed for it being after class since I was only a few rooms down the hall &amp; it would be less awkward. It didn't work. She said that it would be okay &amp; that she would do everything, but it didn't help much. During class, p60 came in &amp; asked if I could come out. When I did, she introduced me to p59 (\p59.pronunciation.name\, I'm pretty sure I spelled it right, a girl of course). In the very short meeting, she said that she was in my Chemistry class. Although I didn't show it, I was really surprised. I had no idea. I don't know how I could have missed something like that. You would think anyone would be able to pick up on someone from another country but apparently not. There wasn't much more to the meeting, &amp; I went back to class.
					</section>
					<section class="t16 t23">
						The only problem I have with having girls as friends is that I can't tell whether I'm thinking of them as just friends or as something more &amp; if it's okay that I am (you already know what happens in a scenario like that). This creates a lot of problems when the majority of people that talk to me are girls (I'm telling you, it's completely true. I still don't know why). Hopefully, I'll eventually get over it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, sure enough, the next time I went to science, I found p59 sitting in the third desk behind mine. I still don't know how I didn't notice that. I must have stood no more than 2 feet away from her at least once while asking <span class="person p61">the teacher</span> questions. <span class="t13">Once I set my stuff down, I went over &amp; asked her the German questions I had carefully planned out in my mind, a process which has been repeated every time before science class since then.</span> She's nice &amp; speaks with a German accent, but it's not too bad. However, she speaks fairly quietly a bunch of the time (which I'll admit I do too), &amp; it's hard to tell what she's saying through the accent.
					</section>
					<section>
						When she tries to answer my questions, I notice 2 things. 1: she wasn't really taught much about her language just like here which should be a fundemental part of our education (&amp; they wonder why so many people are illiterate) &amp; 2: although she gets by well in normal conversation, she doesn't know enough words to adequately explain something fully in the way she wants to. I told her she could write down a word in German that I could look-up later if she felt like I needed it to better understand, but something's telling me that she's not going to do that. She seems to do everything she can to not do anything that would inconvenience anyone in any way because of how she's not an expert at English. It's okay with me that she's not an expert at English especially because I can understand what it's like since I'm learning Spanish &amp; German, &amp; plan to learn more languages.
					</section>
					<section class="t22">
						It was surprising how fast p59 included me in her circle of friends since I opened up dialogue by asking her questions on German. I was especially surprised when there was a group activity in class, &amp; she came over actively trying to get me to join her group before <span class="person p61">the teacher</span> was even done talking. I've seen people doing that with others before, but I don't remember anyone ever doing thatfor me (although I don't think it's too unlikely that I was one of those people years &amp; years ago). It's not like I was the only friend she had in the class; she's been accumulating friends close to where she sits. It wasn't a 2-person activity, so they were in the group too.
					</section>
					<section class="t14 t24">
						It's really sad when a person from another continent fits in better than you. p59 doesn't necessarily better understand what America is like than me, it's just that she finds her niche of people who happily integrate her &amp; converse with her in an easy &amp; flowing manner which is more than I can say. I don't have a lack of people willing to do that stuff for me; I just don't quickly sieze the opportunity, &amp; people usually decide I'd rather be alone before I feel comfortable enough &amp; they learn otherwise. The point is, she's doing pretty well which is good, &amp; it's nice that she hasn't just left me in the dirt.
					</section>
					<section class="t14">
						As I think about these "tragic" events that keep me lonely, I think more &amp; more that I should make some changes (which I've always known I should, but it never got too serious because I wasn't nearly completely alone). I've only gotten less out-going over the years, &amp; I need to do something about it. I'm not saying I'm going to suddenly become some super talkative person or even get very out-going at all, but I know when a certain circumstance is able to lead to a less lonely future. Let me give you a few examples. Rather than smile a tiny bit &amp; wave when someone says hi, I could actually say hi back. Rather than hold in every comment I have about a person, I could force myself to say a few of the more joking ones. Rather than keeping quiet in a conversation directed at a group of people I'm in or within the group, I could maybe try to find a place where I can add something. Rather than cringing away so much when someone intentionally comes in contact with me because I like my personal space &amp; it's weird (such as p38 poking me), I could not respond if it's short &amp; only move farther away if it lasts. I need to do something, so I'm not lonely forever. Also, I feel bad when people try to break me out of my shell &amp; it doesn't work which is the dumbest problem anyone can ever have because <em>I'm</em> the reason it's not working, &amp; I <em>want</em> them to break me out of my shell. It's just ridiculous. I feel awkward really easily &amp; want to make absolutely sure I'm not doing anything even a little wrong, so I don't know how much of this I'll follow through on, but being so lonely is wearing me down.
					</section>
					<section>
						Things are very much the same at school this year. 5 out of 8 of my classes are the same hour as they were last year. My math class even has almost all of the same people in it (although it isn't the same hour).
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						It's marching season in band, &amp; it's going pretty well. 2 new freshmen, p62 &amp; p63, decided they'd try to befriend me. Something about band causes me to not be so stiff. Maybe it's because we're doing something that I can talk about, but there's nothing determining what I should do except in a loose sense. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/2/29">(There's stuff to talk about and not much preventing me from bringing it up.)</span> I hope I don't mess it up.
					</section>
					<section>
						Science is once again extremely easy &amp; boring. One thing different, though, is that <span class="person p61">the science teacher</span> is actually willing to answer my questions. Typically, my science teachers have not seemed very interested in science. I always want to expand my scientific knowledge, &amp; my science teachers never encourage that whatsoever. I think this one is different. The problem is, I can't ask science questions &amp; German questions at the same time.
					</section>
					<section>
						This year, my English teacher doesn't seem as strict as English teachers normally are which is also good.
					</section>
					<section>
						Spanish is once again going to be a waste of a class period because <span class="h3">I know literally everything they're teaching</span>. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span>

								I've read far ahead of where Spanish II is which is why I already know this stuff.

								The Spanish classes were paced so that each year would take you through half of the Spanish textbook. I read through both books multiple times (which took me through Spanish IV), and I even managed to get my hands on a third book which I mostly read through before I lost my interest in Spanish. I focused mainly on the grammar rules, so I wasn't quite learning <em>everything</em>, but there wasn't much left, and it would only take me a day or so to memorize the list of new vocabulary words when they came up in class.
							</section>
						</aside>
						Spanish is already painfully slow, so learning absolutely nothing new except for some vocabulary words doesn't help. I ask <span class="person p64">the Spanish teacher</span> more advanced questions, but it's not enough. I want two credits of Spanish before I move on to French (the only other language taught here) which is why I voluntarily went into this abyss of boredom.
					</section>
					<section>
						P.E. is this year because, like I said last year, they left out social studies, &amp; I had to figure out what I was going to put off. Once again, I've gained the reputation of fastest runner. In reality, I'm pretty sure that I only have somewhat better natural ability &amp; that I seem so much better than everyone else because I actually try all the time. Naturally, this year, most of the people are a year younger than me, but I've always been one of the fastest. I'm also pretty good at other physical activities too which is why I wonder why there are always a bunch of people picked before me to be on someone's team. I know it has to do with those people being friends, but you would think that they would at least sometimes get tired of losing &amp; pick people based on how good they are. A few people have tried to recuit me to do track, but they hardly do anymore because I'm not giving any sort of definite answer. I don't think it would be too bad to join track, but it would take up a lot of time, &amp; I guess I need people to make it seem like they would really want me to be there before I give up a large part of my free-time.
					</section>
					<section>
						In P.E., another girl, of course, p65, decided she'd try to break me out of my shell &amp; made it her job to get me to say hi. I can't remember if this next part happened before or after the date I have at the beginning of this entry, but it was really close. One day, I did say hi to her (as opposed to waving silently) because it would make her happy, &amp; I didn't want her to decide it's a lost cause. After that, she moved on to trying to get me to say, "What's up?" At that point, I told her how I actually can speak &amp; then a mostly one-sided started (not my side) about wondering about why I'm so quiet. Towards the end, <span class="p0">the one person that was in my grade</span> &amp; had already given up on getting me to talk said how she should just let me be. p65 then said how she would leave me alone, &amp; I, yet again, had driven someone away. She's still nice to me &amp; seems as though she still wants to get me to talk but keeps her distance because she doesn't want to become annoying. Hopefully, I can salvage this in the drawn-out, hardly noticeable way that I do.
					</section>
					<section>
						My last class is History just like last year. I even have <span class="person p47">the same teacher</span> even though she only started teaching World History this year. Other than history, she likes to talk about things such as how she ate her goat because it wouldn't eat the right weeds, what she would do in the event of a zombie apocalypse, &amp; her critiques on various action-packed movies. It makes for an interesting class.
					</section>
					<section>
						If you'll notice the date of this entry, you'll know it's the anniversary of 9-11. I was wondering if p59 knew what it was, but I heard quiet voices behind me while it was being talked about over the intercom, so I think she was told. It's depressing. My mind has a way of shielding me from getting too upset, but it's still sad. The part that gets me the most is how a bunch of people jumped out of the buildings when they knew they couldn't make it out. <span class="h-u3">It's not the most comfortable sight.</span> I think it's just ridiculous how some people would do that; it's not right. What also isn't right is hating all Muslims because the psychopaths that did it happened to have that religion. People need to learn to dislike only the people who do bad things &amp; not everyone who shares a quality with them.
					</section>
					<section>
						The new World Trade Center is just about finished. It looks pretty cool, and from what it sounds like on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(American_TV_program)">Nova</a>, they're going to have a hard time doing damage to it even if they run another plane into it. I think it's good that we're rebuilding there &amp; that we also have a memorial. Let's hope we don't need to do it again.

						Two days ago, the band went to a contest. The contest is a thing where we perform our half-time show, &amp; judges score how well we do. It took about 3 hours for the 3 busses to get to the place. We parked on a not too big parking lot, &amp;, after we got our instruments from the trailer, attempted to practice a little in between the other busses &amp; bands. It didn't work well.
					</section>
					<section>
						It was interesting to see other bands. A few of them had purple &amp; white colors for their school like us, &amp; we complimented each other on the good choice of colors.
					</section>
					<section>
						From the parking lot, we marched down a street to a place where we waited outside a football field to go on. When it was finally our time, we marched to the back of the field. As we marched on to take our places, the whole right half of our formation began to lag behind because we didn't know which of the more than normal lines to stop on. We figured it out, but I could feel our points going down on the spot.
					</section>
					<section>
						People clapped after we finished performing, &amp; we marched off. We stayed afterwards to watch other bands perform. They were pretty good &amp; some of them marched in cool ways in certain parts to go with the music. After a while, we made our way back to the busses &amp; left. On the way out, another band yelled good-bye to us from their busses which was funny.
					</section>
					<section>
						The bus ride back was about the same as the bus ride there except it was darker, &amp; it wasn't raining as much. Speaking of rain, I think somewhere along the trip there, the right windshield wiper of the bus fell off. It was weird watching a little stub go back &amp; forth. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.
					</section>
					<section>
						In the end, I got home around 9:00. They said they'll tell us how the judges scored us when they tell them. I don't think we did too bad, but I'm not getting my hopes up. At least it wasn't that bad taking the trip.

						On Saturday (a week ago), my cousin p66 got married. It was quite different, &amp; you would have a hard time trying to find something traditional. The first thing different was where the marriage was held. The reception was in a big, abandoned cotton mill &amp; the wedding was outside. There was apparently an art show that is held there every year which we didn't see much of, but it comes into play later. The dresses that were worn were certainly interesting; the bridesmaids (her sisters) all had swirly, temporary tatoos on their hands &amp; arms &amp; had peacock feathers on their heads &amp; faces. <span class="p0">One person</span> looked like a big, red tree without leaves. p66 was dressed in white with really elaborate swirly, temporary tatoos (they called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henna">henna</a> painting), &amp; where wings would have been if she had dressed like an angel, she had something like white branches. The groom, p67 (his nickname is p67.extra1 because he has a long moustache that he curls into a circle on each side), was dressed in a suit with a top hat.
					</section>
					<section>
						The "preacher" was <span class="p0">one of their friends</span> who passed an online course to give a wedding. He used a megaphone to give the ceremony. There wasn't much structure to the wedding, so it was kind-of hard to tell what was going on. I haven't been to too many weddings, so I'm not exactly sure what a completely normal wedding is, but I'm pretty sure the things said during the ceremony were fairly normal. Afterwards, we got a flower petal &amp; a white rose to throw into the Mississippi River. Most of the people in the wedding joined the art festival people in a parade to the river. The most interesting part was the bikes that were covered to look like giant sea turtles which moved their heads &amp; front fins while they moved. We eventually made it down to the river &amp; threw the flowers in. The people from the art festival threw in a bunch of other stuff which made me wonder what happens to that polluting, non-biodegradable stuff.
					</section>
					<section>
						After standing around not doing much, we went back to the reception. There wasn't much to eat which made me sad, but there were weird, multicolored balls of cake on sticks &amp; covered in icing. They weren't all the same type of cake, &amp; since they were covered in icing, you couldn't really tell what type you were getting.
					</section>
					<section>
						Not much else happened except for people talking, so we eventually left. At night, a giant, wooden art thing was burned, but we didn't have a bunch of stuff to do for hours to use up that time, &amp; we live too far away from where the wedding was held to go back.

						Yesterday was my p68's <span class="person p69">daughter</span>'s Halloween party. That may sound like a strange, possibly unsafe thing to go to (because of not too well-known adults at a fairly private event), but I assure you, it was fine. This was my (&amp; my parents') 2<sup>nd</sup> time going.
					</section>
					<section>
						After about the first half of October is over, my p68 starts trying to get people to go to <span class="person p69">her daughter</span>'s Halloween party which is mostly centered around a walkway through her wooded backyard where people are meant to be scared. She plans it to be on the Saturday before Halloween. I'm pretty sure there are at least a few other people from the bus that go, but it's my parents' style (mostly p1's, but not always) to arrive at places fashionably late (except without the fashionably part), so I couldn't say definitely. By the time we got there, only a mass of relatives were left.
					</section>
					<section>
						Pretty much right after we arrived, we went into the path. I think this year wasn't quite as scary as last year, but it wasn't too bad. The part that makes it all worth it is watching p2's reactions. She acts like she does when there's a spider coming towards her; she isn't seriously scared but acts pretty ridiculous. The best part of the path was the end. There was a maze set up, &amp; absolutely no light was let in. As you walk around, people placed in the maze scare you, sometimes flashing a light. Once you finally feel your way out of the maze, if you look back at what you were walking through, it's really pathetic how much time is spent in something so small. Almost immediately after we exited the walkway, it was shut down because it was time for it to end.
					</section>
					<section>
						That was pretty much the end of the most interesting stuff. People were crowded around a fire to keep warm even though it wasn't too cold. Food &amp; drinks were outside, so people could eat &amp; drink there. Eventually, someone got out a game where you try to throw beanbags into a hole <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/14">(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole">Cornhole</a>)</span>. I got to play for awhile, but there was soon no one to play with. <span class="t13">I decided to juggle with the beanbags (which I'm good at &amp; will likely talk about later)</span> &amp; left soon after. The p68 says it will be better next year, so that will be interesting.

					<section>
						Today is Halloween! I wish it wouldn't be weird to go trick-or-treating no matter how old you got. I miss costumes &amp; trick-or-treating. One thing I don't miss is going out in the rain like I would have today. Now, not much happens, &amp; it's boring. However, this actually isn't the real reason I decided to write today.
					</section>
					<section class="t7 t22">
						This has been the 3<sup>rd</sup> time p63 (one of the band members who tried to befriend me) decided to sit with me at lunch (&amp; I say 3 times in a row is enough to know that it will keep happening). At first, she would come to my table every once in a while or find me in the stands at the football games the band played at saying that I seemed lonely (which I was). Although her heart was in the right spot, she can't hold an entire conversation by herself like some people I know which was partly why I would try to add some things in the many awkward silences especially because I feel bad for people who try to make me feel included &amp; don't get much of a response. On the last football game, I told her that, although my blank face doesn't show it, I appreciated what she was doing. I think that was a determining factor as to why she decided to begin sitting with me.
					</section>
					<section>
						It turns out that we get along really well. As I learn more about her, I find more &amp; more things we have in common. That's not to say that I can only get along with people like me, but it makes it so much easier to relate &amp; understand each other. I don't think I've talked to anyone so much in years; that's including my parents. I'm sure some of it has to do with not getting it out with other people &amp; having only a relatively short time to talk to her, but I don't think it would be the same without us being so well suited for each other.
					</section>
					<section>
						p63 is nice &amp;, like I said, shares many similarities with me. She says how she doesn't have much of a middle ground &amp; goes from really talkative to awkwardly silent which I have beared witness to plenty of times. (Lately, though, she's been staying at talkative around me.) She has medium-length dark hair with highlights &amp; needs glasses although I don't always see her with them. In order to give you a more complete description of her, she's a little overweight, but it's not that big of a deal. In case you forgot from earlier, she's a freshman which is fine with me; I think it's ridiculous how everyone always makes fun of freshmen. She says that she "has OCD" &amp; can't sit still too long, but I haven't really noticed it.
					</section>
					<section>
						A week ago, which was the 2<sup>nd</sup> time p63 sat with me, p38 decided she'd give me internal struggles (this also reaffirmed that I'm over that ridiculousness, besides, I had to make room for more). I could tell that she was upset when she came over, but based on the way she tried to start conversations completely unrelated to it, I decided she didn't want to talk about it. <span class="t22">I had forgotten how nice she is.</span> She was carrying on conversations, being perfectly polite, &amp; was inquisitive about the new person she hadn't seen me with before. My problem arose when p63 walked away for a short time. <span class="t25">When she was out of earshot, p38 said something like, "Look at you flirting, Robert! I'm proud of you!"</span> After giving her the stare of death, she said how she was kidding, but I don't think she actually was. I was doing such a good job at keeping myself free from thoughts beyond friend involving p63, so I wasn't thrilled to have that taken away from me. The rest of lunch was uneventful, but although I can't be sure, I remember having the slight impression that p38 was emphasizing the fact that she had a boyfriend to show that she wasn't with me &amp; imply that I'm still available.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						You can't even begin to imagine how much those 2 sentences p38 said consumed my every thought. It's a good thing I didn't have much homework because I couldn't concentrate (&amp; still can't to a degree). At first, all I could do was groan internally, but as the days went by, &amp; it went through my head over &amp; over &amp; over again, I slowly began to allow myself to reasonably assess the situation, &amp; in reality, there's probably some truth to it.
					</section>
					<section>
						On Tuesday, p63 <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span> wasn't at school due to strep throat as I found out later.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">The only reason I can spell her name right is because I asked &amp; later saw it.</aside>
						p38, I think because she saw me alone, made a rare, second trip to sit at my table. Seeing her come over, I just knew what she would want to talk about, but I tried to hold out hope. It didn't last long. Before she even sat down, she asked, "Where's your little girlfriend?" Apparently, the only thing worth talking about was p63. I questioned her girlfriend statement, &amp; she started to reconsider what she said but then decided she liked that the best &amp; stuck with it. Very soon after, she said, "Is she your girlfriend? ... Oh my gosh! She's your girlfriend, isn't she?" I was originally just staring at her <span class="elaborate">for reasons that I'll explain in another entry</span>, but seeing that it was going too far, I told her in a definite way that she wasn't my girlfriend.
						<aside class="reflection t4" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2024/3/17">
							I drag this out for a really long time, and it's nothing too crazy anyway. Basically, I don't want to lie to people, but I also don't want to always expose my secrets, so I avoid potentially problematic questions by staying silent and acting like the person is ridiculous for asking the question. I do this even if I shouldn't be worried about my answer because, if I always answered when it would work out for me but never when it wouldn't, it would be essentially the same as always saying what my answer was.
						</aside>
						She asked me why not &amp; I told her I don't do things that fast. At some point, p38 asked, "But you <em>do</em> like her?" I held out through the multiple times she asked, but it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to come to a conclusion. If I was asked that question now, I would probably make no eye-contact &amp; slowly nod my head in a barely noticeable way. She says that she likes me, but she only knows her from that one meeting at lunch. However, although I don't want to jump to conclusions, I don't think it would take too much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that p63 shares at least some of what I feel.
					</section>
					<section class="t17 t22 t31">
						I feel so awkward &amp; embarassed, but talking with her makes me so happy. My cheek muscles aren't used to smiling that much. I don't remember ever having 2 emotions so completely mixed. In the exact same moment that I want to put my head down &amp; get rid of all illogical thoughts on the awkward subject, I want to smile &amp; think even more about it. I've always prided myself in being able to separate my emotions (&amp; reasoning) so they could be given proper weight &amp; evaluated reasonably. For the longest time, I couldn't distinguish the parts of my conflicting "single" feeling. I was surprised by how intertwined they were.
					</section>
					<section>
						p38 talked more about p63 &amp; some other things, but I said the most important things.
					</section>
					<section>
						Today, p63 was back, &amp; we could talk at lunch again (we only have lunch together on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays). After lunch was about half over, some somewhat obnoxious people came to sit at my end of the row of tables as they do every once in a while because it's pretty empty around me, &amp; they're "scared" of a few girls at their table. Unlike p38, p63, &amp; me <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span>, they say whatever's on their mind.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">p38 wasn't there today, &amp; I don't expect her to make a habit of coming over.</aside>
						Not much time went by before I was asked if she was my girlfriend. I was too busy giving <span class="p0">the asker</span> my stare of death, so I didn't see p63's reaction, but in my opinion, there was a considerable pause before she said we were just friends.
					</section>
					<section>
						Sometimes they would become preoccupied enough that p63 &amp; I could talk. She said how it's ridiculous how, any time she's seen talking to someone, her friends think they're dating. There were a few more things she said, but I couldn't believe how much what she was saying coincided with exactly what I would say. What she said was as close to literally word-for-word what I would say as humanly possible including the way she said it &amp; her facial expressions. It was uncanny. This is also one of the reasons I'm inclined to believe that she might be thinking the same thing about us as I am because I would only say something like that if I felt awkward &amp; wanted to seem like it wasn't too big of a deal &amp; so talked a little about it because immediately changing the conversation would be suspicious, but I wouldn't talk about it too long because, for one thing, it would be too awkward, but also, talking about it too long would make it seem like it was completely out of the question, &amp; although it's too early to make a commitment like that, it might not be too horrible of an idea. (Did you get all of that?) Those people that say whatever they think of also confirmed for me that p63 doesn't have a boyfriend. On another note, before they came over, I wanted to be sure I wasn't depriving her of her other friends, so I asked, &amp; she told me in a reassuring way that I'm not.
					</section>
					<section class="t23">
						It's a time like this when I think about what p1 told me months ago. He said that I better not just run off with the first girl I meet. I asked him why he thought I would do that, &amp; he said that all kids (which can be anywhere from a baby to someone in their 20's) think they've found the love of their life in a way meant to say kids are dumb &amp; can't control their emotions, advice told to me many times by him. P1 always offers conflicting advice like that; not necessarily conflicting with itself (although sometimes) but conflicting with previous advice. Some examples of this &amp; other comments are that I should ask questions when I'm not sure but I should figure out what he wants me to do without asking; I'm too logical &amp; am like a robot but I'm dumb in many instances &amp; let my emotions get the best of me; I'm too quiet &amp; it's going to cause everyone to hate me &amp; I'll be alone forever but I can be such a lady's-man that I need tons of advice on how to treat girls while I'm with them. It's just ridiculous. Since I don't want to give any merit to ridiculous claims, it bugs me when there might be something that comes close to doing so. Apparently, I don't have enough problems, so now I have to worry about whether I'm getting carried away. I actually don't quite think so, but there's plenty of doubt.
					</section>
					<section class="t14 t22">
						Even though I now have a bunch of other things to worry about, I much prefer things the way they are now. I'm sick of being lonely. Now that I have p63 to talk to, I've noticed that it doesn't matter to me too much anymore when people don't end up talking to me. I still want them to, but it doesn't bother me. That just goes to show that all I needed was one, good person to talk to. A little extra information to go along with that is that I often see p63 standing off by herself. One time, I said how she reached out to me because I looked lonely, but she's alone a bunch of the time too. She said, when she talks to her friends, they tend to migrate away from her, but it's okay now that there's me. I really don't know why people tend to migrate away from her so often.
					</section>
					<section class="t14 t22">
						I'm not dumb enough to be oblivious to what this entry in my journal / autobiography suggests (if you call it a diary, you may find yourself being thrown out of a window), but aside from the ridiculousness, I'm very, very happy to not be so alone anymore, &amp; if nothing else, I think p63 &amp; I make really good friends.

						I really didn't want to put 2 entries about p63 back to back because it doesn't tell you much about my life, &amp; I could go on forever talking about what I feel day to day, but I just have to talk about this. I'm going to string you along for awhile to give you a better understanding, so try to be patient.

						I've planned, since probably the conception of this journal, to give the notebooks this was originally written in (as in before this got published which is probably before you are reading this) to whoever I decided I'd try to make my girlfriend because it's easier for me to write about my feelings regarding that than to talk about them &amp; because it would talk about my life which would tell her what she's getting into. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2016?">Side note</span>

						Once this idea had circulated around my head a while, I decided that the best day of the week to give this to whoever it was would be Friday because it would leave the whole weekend to read this increasingly long journal &amp; decide what she would do.

					<section class="t12">
						In seemingly unrelated news, although any romantic <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span> thoughts &amp; therefore actions are omnipotently oppressed due to my intense feeling of awkwardness, I've always thought I'd try to force myself to dig up at least some of it for Valentine's Day.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">
							I prefer the more innocent word "sweet", but I'm not sure how well it would fit &amp; it has 2 meanings which would just make it confusing.
						</aside>
						I wondered if I would do the same thing for an anniversary, &amp; it's not out of the question, but I figured an easy way to not worry about that was to take steps to cause the anniversary to be on Valentine's Day ("anniversary" can also count as a dating anniversary). Besides, it would be more romantic that way. However, I didn't know if I would prefer to get myself to indirectly ask someone out <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/21">(using my journal)</span> on a Friday or on Valentine's Day.
					</section>
					<section>
						Today, I was once again thinking about p63 &amp; started to go down a hypothetical path related to these previously mentioned ponderings. I began to wonder what day of the week Valentine's Day is going to be on this year to know how something like that might play out &amp; compare it to a scenario on a Friday in case I might one day work up the nerve, when it's far too obvious to ignore, to maybe use that information. Eventually, it bugged me enough to look in my school planner to figure it out. ... Valentine's Day is on a Friday. ...
					</section>
					<section>
						When I found that out I nearly passed out. My parents weren't home yet, &amp; since I now had tons of nervous energy, I paced back &amp; forth (which I pretty much never do) for an easy 20 minutes. <span class="h-o3">There must be a foot deep trench going through the middle of the living room by now.</span> For the longest time, I couldn't even sit down to write this. If Valentine's Day was on <em>any</em> other day of the week, it would be something to just idly consider. If it was in a week or two, it would be too soon, &amp; I would put it off. But it's not; it's Valentine's Day, <em>and</em> it's a Friday, <em>and</em> it's a few months away. If just one of those things weren't true, it wouldn't get too serious, but they're all true, &amp; ... I might actually follow through.
					</section>
					<section>
						It scares me to put a specific time on something so awkward, but I do like her. It still amazes me how well we get along. When I'm around her, I can feel happiness radiating from her, &amp; it wouldn't take much convincing to make me believe that's what people feel coming off of me. I feel like I did when p38 "joked" about me flirting with p63: unbearably awkward with severely impaired concentration. However, I don't think you need reminding that that ended with me reluctantly accepting it as truth.

						At some point last year, p41 (\p41.pronunciation.lastName\), the now retired after 30-something years Odyssey teacher, had us write an Americanism essay which was then entered into a contest.

						Because I did so well, p56.extra1 wanted me to come to a school board meeting to be recognized. While I was there, I was asked to read my essay. I could have declined <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/3/23">(I was given the option of someone else reading it)</span>, &amp; it wouldn't have surprised too many people because of how quiet I am, but I always think it's better when people read their own stuff, &amp; I knew everyone would think so too. I'm good at making my voice not sound nervous despite every single other fiber in my entire body being absolutely petrified. I think I read it quite well. Be glad I'm not p1 who reads in the most monotone voice you've ever heard &amp; never stops reading once he starts even when we (p2.extra1 &amp; I) ask him to because we're no longer paying attention.

					<section>
						The essay was about voting, how good it is, &amp; how we shouldn't squander it. Its title was "Voting for the Future". I may or may not put the essay at the end of this entry when it comes time to publish this, but I'm too lazy to write it all down now. My favorite part is at the very end where it says, "The future is in our hands, and the last thing we should do with it is clench our fists." I didn't remember what my essay said before reading it because it had been something like half of a year, so I was happily surprised. <span class="h3">I always do what I can to not brag except where I'm obviously joking</span>, so I'm not going to emphasize how good that sentence or the rest of my essay was.
					</section>
					<section class="t18 t23">
						While I'm on that subject, there are plenty of times when I feel like this entire journal is a huge brag itself especially when I bring up this getting published in the future. It seems to me that you would have to have an extremely big head to be so confident in becoming famous that you would start writing an autobiography before hardly anyone cared about you at all. Because of that, I barely started writing this journal, &amp; I think the main reason I started to &amp; continue to write in this is because I want to get out my thoughts, &amp; I don't get many opportunities for that (I know that sounds like a diary, but you're still going to get thrown out of a window if you call it that). Also, there are many things I don't feel comfortable talking about but am willing to write down when no one's around to read it. I hope that you don't think I'm bragging, &amp; if you do, just know that it's not meant that way, &amp; I hope you don't think too badly of me because of it.

						Back to the main subject of this entry, I think me reading my essay at the board meeting which was put in the newspaper a few days later was the main reason p56 asked me to read it for the Veteran's Day assembly; he knew I might be willing, so he thought he'd try. When the day came (today), I dressed nice &amp; got prepared. <span class="t7">On the way to the band room to get our stuff to play for the assembly, I told p63 how she better not laugh at me if I pass out in front of everyone.</span> She said how she was sorry for me &amp; would probably cry if I passed out.

						Reading my essay went about like it did at the board meeting: a good reading voice with an otherwise paralyzed body. When I'm about to speak in front of a bunch of people, I always think I'm going to sound bad, but I somehow manage to sound okay. I try to convince myself that talking to a bunch of people is no different from talking to just one person, &amp; if it doesn't scare me to talk to one person, it shouldn't scare me to talk to a bunch of people (which is true), but I can never quite get mself to believe it. I try to use reasoning like, if one person wouldn't judge me, why would a bunch of one persons do so, &amp; all I'm doing is reading a paper which uses next to no thought or concentration which would cause me to have many opportunities to mess up. It still doesn't work. Maybe if I talk in front of a bunch of people more often, I'll get over this ridiculous fear.

However, far too early for my tastes, he started critiquing me as he does absolutely every single time I do anything he notices particularly in public. At least I made it through, &amp; plenty of people commended me for it which was nice.

						<span class="person p70">Our cat</span> died today. It's sad. I'm assuming it happened overnight because there was a note left for me when I came home by p2 who leaves for work in the morning. Her name was p70 (that's how p2 spelled it when filling out something for her, probably due to the similarity of Robbie). She was a nice cat with large brown &amp; black spots on a white body who decided she wanted to sit in our laps all the time since we moved. She was older than me: something like 18. I have 4 videos of her on my phone: one of her hissing at the neighbors' energetic dog, one of her flipping her tail every I pet towards the end of her back, one of her staying on my lap no matter how much I wiggled, &amp; one of her snoring (I know, it's weird). I wanted to get a video of her pulling her water dish all over the place before she drank out of it like she always did, but I never got around to it.

					<section>
						Although this may sound bad, I don't think p70 dying is the worst part; I think it was yesterday. For the past few weeks, she would have a seizure every few days. We didn't go to the vet (like I would have) because p1 thinks they're too expensive &amp; don't really help much anyway, &amp; p2 doesn't have much of an opinion. Yesterday, the seizures became a losely grouped hourly occurrence &amp; were worse. I could fairly vividly describe what they were like, but I don't want to depress a bunch of people, &amp; I don't particularly want to relive it, so I'll just say that it was horribly sad to see her helplessness &amp; hear her desperate meows. I have to admit that there were a few times it was hard for me to hold it together while in the heat of it. It's going to be sad all over again when we have to bury her when p1 gets home. I hope everything will turn out okay.

						We also talked about other things, &amp; at one point, p63 quite abruptly asked for my phone number as if that's what she always does once she gets to know people well enough, &amp; she had forgotten to ask before (which very well could be right). Naturally, having caller ID for people who call would be preferable, &amp; the only way I can make it is if I have a phone number which was therefore given to me. She said something about me texting &amp; saying it's me, so a little after I got home, that's what I did. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/4/9">(I would keep my phone at home because using phones at school wasn't allowed, so why should I bring it?)</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t27">
						Although it's not easily apparent when I'm not really talking to people which is often the case, I have a lot to say as p63 must as well at least to an extent; we ended up texting for a nearly solid 5 hours which <span class="elaborate">used about an hour of my minutes</span> &amp; would have made my phone go dead if I hadn't plugged it in <span class="afterthought" data-date="2024/4/9">(whereas my battery would normally last for 2 days or so)</span>.
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2024/4/9">
							Although, even at the time, people would be surprised to discover that there was a limit on my texts (and minutes and data), with the phone plan I had, you would buy what you expected to use beforehand, and if you ran out before you got more, you would lose the ability to use your phone. In this case, you would actually buy minutes, and texts would use a certain proportion of a minute (0.3). While buying minutes, you would typically also be buying service days (pretty much universally 90), and if you wanted to maintain use of your phone, you would have to make sure to buy more minutes before you ran out of service days. My parents would always buy me the minimum number of minutes (60, which my phone would triple to 180) because that was the cheapest, and I didn't talk to anyone anyway. On the bright side, as long as you kept your service active, your minutes would roll over, so I had started accumulating quite a large number of minutes.
						</aside>
						I can't believe it ended up being that long; I can hardly spend that much time on <em>anything</em>. <span class="t28">It makes me think about the people I see on the TV &amp; the few others I know of who are joined at the hip to their phone &amp; spend hours upon hours on it. I always think those people are ridiculous. Maybe I need to reevaluate myself &amp; others too.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						We were just talking about stuff as we would in a normal conversation except through texting. During the course of it, I learned her sister's name is p72, &amp; she's 7. There were a few times the conversation almost stopped, but I didn't really want it to &amp; neither did she. Today, I told her at school that we can't text that much again, &amp; she knew it too, but I wouldn't take back yesterday, though. I enjoyed getting each text &amp; felt almost like I was sitting with her at her house.
					</section>
					<section class="t22">
						Even as I was writing the beginning of this entry, I thought it sort-of lacked a theme &amp; just started babbling on. I suppose I'm telling you how things are progressing with p63 which pretty much everyone I know would consider the most interesting part of my life. To get to the point, I like her very very much. I guess thinking about it almost every waking moment (&amp; a fair amount of sleeping moments) gets me used to the idea enough to be able to write it in here. There are a bunch of times when I wonder if I'm thinking that just because that's what I keep telling myself, but when I start thinking about the reasoning behind why I like her, absolutely all doubt about it being real disappears (&amp; it's nearly impossible to instill absolute confidence in me). She makes me smile, laugh, &amp; talk more than anyone else, &amp; we think on the same wavelength &amp; agree on countless things. Although those are all good reasons, I think the one that tops it off is that she likes me too. Someone could be the perfect fit for someone else, but if, at the end of the day, <span class="elaborate">the time with them could have just as easily been spent with a different person</span> / they aren't interested, it pretty much ends it right there (at least it would for me anyway). Of course, p63 hasn't directly said she likes me (as I haven't) but leaves enough clues for it to be fairly obvious (also like me). Some of those clues are how she waits for me when we're going to go in the same direction in the halls &amp; I'm falling behind, always smiles when I'm talking with her, &amp; walked with me all the way to the stairwell even though her next class was right next to the <span class="t7">band room</span> &amp; she had everything she needed (if she does it again which I have a feeling she will, I'm going to do the same sort of thing for her). Also, I can't have a 5-hour texting conversation with a wall.
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2024/4/11">
						Since it may not be totally clear what I mean here, I'll say that I was referring whether it was meaningful that the person was talking to me as opposed to someone else. Some people are just talkative people, and although they may enjoy talking with me, it wouldn't be very difficult for them to enjoy talking to someone else. There were quite a few people like that in high school (usually the ones trying to break me out of my shell). It seems more meaningful when there aren't many people who they would appreciate talking to as much, and it seemed that p63 fell into that category.
					</aside>
					<section class="t28">
						<span class="t1">If I have any say in it whatsoever, p63 will be receiving this journal on Valentine's Day.</span> <span class="e76">I just like her so much.</span> This sort of thing makes me think of all the people who say similar things &amp; who I think are so ridiculous. I wish the world was composed of mostly reasonable &amp; mild people so I could tell if I'm right for thinking <em>most</em> of those people are ridiculous (which wouldn't include me) or if I'm a lot worse of a judge of character than I thought / am too harsh. I'm not sure, &amp; it's going to bug me for much longer than I would prefer.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, if I say everything now, there won't be anything left to say on February 13<sup>th</sup> (I have to write the entry before I give it to her). ... I suppose the only thing left to say is welcome (officially) to my journal, p63.

					<section>
						On Thursday, we had Thanksgiving. We actually visited family on multiple days, but Thanksgiving was on Thursday (as it always is, the 4<sup>th</sup> one of the month that is). The best part about Thanksgiving being on a Thursday is the 4-day weekend. Who doesn't like 4 days off? Wednesday was even an early release day, so the weekend started even earlier!
					</section>
					<section class="t14">
						All of my family whose relation to me I can easily describe &amp; who I pretty much ever see (except for <span class="p0">the new, few month old baby</span>) is older than me. The youngest people who fall in that category are 5 years older than me. <span class="h-u2">My parents having me at 40 probably plays some sort of a role in that.</span> Due to this age-gap, our infrequency of visiting, &amp; me becoming ever more quiet, family get-togethers have become an increasingly non-social event for me. I wish it wasn't like that, but I don't know if I have it in me to change it when everyone else is just fine talking to other people. Most get-togethers consist of only talking &amp; eating, so <span class="h-u2">I wouldn't consider them the most thrilling affairs for me.</span> However, this time I took full advantage of that second constituent.
					</section>
					<section>
						On Wednesday, we celebrated Thanksgiving at p1's <span class="person p40">sister</span>'s house. There's always a bunch of food there, &amp; I'm always happy to finally eat my fill unlike at home where I get cut off. Something must have happened between this year &amp; last year because I could never eat that much food before, &amp; I would be left with an immense sense of disappointment. I didn't huff everything down at once; it was a slow but continuous process. More &amp; more food disappeared, &amp; the only reason I stopped was because I was called away to help <span class="p0">someone</span> with a game on their phone (which I did with ease). I didn't even feel stuffed after eating all of that.
					</section>
					<section>
						The next day (Thanksgiving), I got an opportunity to recreate the feat. We went to p2's <span class="person p73">aunt</span>'s house &amp; there was once again plenty of food. Since no one called me away to help them with a game, I was able to eat as long as I wanted to. After a few hours, I felt like you do when you chug down tons of water where you can't drink any more but aren't particularly quenched. I felt somewhat full but by no means like I was about to explode like I should have. I don't know how I can possibly describe to you the mountain-load of food I ate. I must have eaten over &frac13; of all of the food eaten in total, &amp; including me, there were 6 people. <span class="reflection elaborate obvious" data-date="2024/4/12">Alternative phrasing</span> I don't want to overshoot the amount of food I ate, but it seems like even more than that.
					</section>
					<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Alternative phrasing" data-date="2024/4/12">
						In case you're like current me (in the future from this entry) and didn't think that amount of food was too excessive on first read, it may be worth mentioning how another way of saying that same amount is that I ate roughly as much as 3 people on Thanksgiving, and that's a day when everyone tends to eat more than they usually do.
					</aside>
					<section>
						Opposite to what would be expected, I felt perfectly fine after all of that even until we got home &amp; later went to bed. It was the night that was the problem. After only a few hours of sleep, I woke up with a bad feeling in my stomach. I thought going to the bathroom would help but not really. I felt so bad that I tried banging on stuff to get my parents' attention because I couldn't yell. P1 is always up ridiculously late, so he came. I sat for a long time &amp; later tried to move around some to help my stomach digest. Eventually, I went back to bed but couldn't really sleep well &amp; soon had to get back up. This time, I had to throw up. Luckily, I made it to the toilet. <span class="h-u3">It wasn't fun.</span> On the bright side, after the few successive times of throwing up, I felt a whole lot better. Sadly, the next day I had some side effects, but I didn't feel nearly as bad as I did before. We would have went to p2's <span class="person p74">sister</span>'s house if it hadn't been for me not feeling too great. I texted p63 about what happened, looking for sympathy, &amp; I wasn't let down.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing I can say for sure: I'm <em>never</em> eating too much <em>ever</em> again, even if I don't feel full (which I assumed would stop me before this happened).

						Friday, December 20, 2013
					</h2>
					<section>
						This has been quite a full week. I'll go in sequential order for the most part, but I'm saving the most important part until the end.
					</section>
					<section>
						The first thing that happened I need to give you a little background information. One day, p63 asked me what type of chocolate I like (it's dark chocolate, &amp; IT'S NOT BITTER! p63 is also one of the few people awesome enough to fully appreciate dark chocolate). It turns out that she buys chocolate for a few of her friends around Christmas. When I found out she was going to give me something, I thought it might be nice to give her something as well.
					</section>
					<section class="t30">
						After thinking about it awhile, I came up with what to give her &amp; got to work on it. I'm going to wait until Christmas to tell you what's inside, so I can put p63's reaction to it also (she's not allowed by me to open the present until then <span class="t13">which is 432,000 seconds away now</span>). However, if I do say so myself, I think it would melt even the stoniest of hearts. p63 started to feel bad about not making me something which would be more meaningful than something store-bought, so I made a condition of me giving it to her on Monday (also the day I got my chocolate) be that she can't feel bad about it. My present is light &amp; covered with 2 pieces of paper taped together with a face of Santa drawn on the front. <span class="t8">Below the face it says, "<img src="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/journalresources1/things/Encoded Christmas from and to.png" id="christmasFromTo" alt="[A few words written in code]">" which is code (the code p63 knows) for, "From:Santa To:p63".</span> Originally, I was going to try to sneak it into her bag &amp; have it be a surprise, but it didn't work out like that. It's really fun taunting her with what might be inside. I give her just enough clues to wonder but never quite know what's inside. Some of those clues are there's more than 2 things in there, there's a note inside, &amp; there's something that could help pacify her sister (now I'm having fun taunting <em>you</em> with what might be inside). Later that day on Monday, Later that day on Monday, p63 thought she'd be funny &amp; tell me I can't eat my dark chocolate bar until Christmas, but I can wait; I know what it is, &amp; I have plenty of practice from being brought along shopping &amp; not being able to get what I'd like to snack on because we can't waste money on that sort of stuff, &amp; I don't like using my non-replenishing money.
					</section>
					<section>
						For the rest of the week (through Thursday) there were finals. The classes were all made 2 hours, &amp; the schedule was all over the place. Depending on your grades &amp; attendance, you can have up to 3 exemptions (which is how many I got). There are exemption movies in the auditorium, &amp; they're pretty good. I wish p63 had an exemption for me to be at one of the movies with her (she was absent too many days &amp; didn't have a GPA because there wasn't a full semester of high school to go off of).
					</section>
					<section>
						I wish the last thing we did in the semester wasn't tests. I much prefer when things would slow down at the time right before a break (especially summer) so people could enjoy it. Either way, today was the first day of winter break. There are a whole bunch of things I want to do on the time off, but something's telling me I'm not going to get to them all.
					</section>
					<section class="t28">
						Now it's time for the most important part of this entry. I'll start off by saying that Valentine's Day was beginning to seem quite far away; I honestly didn't think I could grow to like someone so much so quickly. It makes me think of all the people I think are moving too quickly for their own good. This is yet another instance when I wish the world was composed of mostly reasonable &amp; mild people to know if I was/am more naive/hypocritical than I think. (P1 would jump to tell you that's definitely true, but <span class="h3">I'm certainly more mature than my age group &amp; easily more mature than a number of adults</span>.) I'm not just in denial; this is a perfectly valid argument. However, I will admit that p63 &amp; I getting along so extremely well causing us to progress so quickly came as quite a surprise.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although it was obvious we got along well, it was starting to bug me not being absolutely sure whether she liked me more than a friend. The moment I thought there was finally enough evidence to think one way, something would happen &amp; throw it all into doubt. I was going back &amp; forth &amp; back &amp; forth &amp; it was really starting to get to me particularly on Tuesday.
					</section>
					<section class="t7">
						Wednesday was the day of the band final. It was the most pathetically easy test you could possibly imagine. The band teachers put very little effort into their finals; there were 7 ridiculously easy questions. As you can imagine, there was a considerable amount of free-time after the test. Just as I always do when there's extra time in band, I found a place to sit next to p63. We talked about various things, &amp; I showed her my awesome orange folder which has pretty much every paper I would ever want in it. <span class="t12">At one point, I was doing a really good job of making her laugh, &amp; <span class="p0" data-revisit="name">someone</span> came over &amp; asked what was wrong. <span class="person p63">She</span> said nothing was wrong, so the person asked, "Then why's your face red? ... And why's <em>your</em> face red?" It was a serious question, &amp; it didn't help keep our faces from getting even more red. It was kind-of awkward but nonetheless funny.</span> <span class="p0">That person</span> ended up sticking around for another 10-20 minutes just listening to what we were talking about because <span class="p0">she</span> said we were having an interesting conversation.
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="t8">I'm pretty sure after <span class="p0">the person</span> left, the conversation drifted to the encoded messages we had been sending back &amp; forth. In them, we just talk about everyday stuff, so it's not like deciphering them is going to divulge tons of close secrets.</span> One of the messages p63 gave me had a flurry of questions related to my favorite things. I had told her that she would probably get less than satisfactory answers because I have mild opinions on most things. I added, though, that if she asked me a question such as who was my favorite person, I wouldn't have to think twice about it. She said she would have to ask me that next time, &amp; wouldn't you know it, she did. My response was long-winded &amp; didn't directly mention her name but had so many specific details that there was definitely no doubt. I got another message from p63 on Wednesday strongly implying that I'm <em>her</em> favorite person. While we were talking, she asked if she really was my favorite person, &amp; after skirting around the question a little, I told her she was. She was beginning to seem slightly hurt &amp; asked if she said something wrong in her message. When I told her no, she asked why I hesitated. I said it was because it was awkward. Once again in a somewhat timid way, p63 asked why it was awkward. I responded by saying that it couldn't possibly be that hard to imagine, &amp; she acknowledged that but insisted. I tried to change the subject to how many seconds there are until things, &amp; she eventually gave up, but I could tell that she had really hoped I would answer.
					</section>
					<section class="t25">
						What followed was the most awkward silence I've ever experienced in my entire life. I stopped what I was doing so it didn't seem like I didn't care, &amp; I felt really bad; I knew she was trying to get me to say that I like her, but I was just too chicken to do so. I couldn't tell beyond a shadow of a doubt whether she wanted to know to put a stop to me going in the wrong direction or if she wanted to know that her feelings are reciprocated, &amp; I was too scared to take the chance. I wish I had more backbone than a worm when it came to stuff like this. Eventually, the silence ended, &amp; we continued talking.
					</section>
					<section>
						When band was over, we walked to our Academic Advisory classes which are really close to each other. At the last possible moment before we parted ways, p63 decided she'd add one more thing. In a hushed voice she said, "People say that you like me. Is that true?" Being the coward that I am for things like that, I went around the question by saying, "Well, that depends; do you <span class="elaborate">...</span> ?"
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Additional information" data-date="2024/4/19">
							I had actually meant to finish that sentence with "like me", but I got so nervous that I choked up on those last words. Luckily, the the first part of the sentence made my question clear enough, so I just decided to end my sentence there.
						</aside>
						As I saw her nod her head, it became apparent how truly hard for her that all was. Knowing I couldn't avoid it any longer, <em>I</em> nodded my head as I looked away. Immediately after I confirmed I liked her, she moved a little closer &amp; gave me a big hug. I made sure she knew I thought it was awkward, but I actually don't think I would have had much of a problem with it if it wasn't in the hallway where everyone could see. Before p63 went into her classroom, I told her, "See why it'd be awkward?" in reference to me saying she's my favorite person. She said ya &amp; apologized like she always does far more than necessary, at least for me anyway. She left after I told her it was alright. ...
					</section>
					<section>
						That Academic Advisory was the least productive Academic Advisory I've ever had, &amp; I've had some <em>really</em> unproductive ones. I remind you that it was even 2 hours. ... I suppose I don't have to wait until Valentine's Day anymore to see if p63 will be my girlfriend. I'll probably still wait until then, though, to give her this. I've never had a girlfriend before, &amp; it turns out, neither has she (a boyfriend that is) <span class="reflection" data-date="2014?">(wrong)</span>. Furthermore, I don't even think that I've ever been hugged by anyone who wasn't related to me <span class="reflection" data-date="2013?">(that might actually be wrong)</span>. ... Although I don't regret it one bit, it's going to take some getting used to. I'm really not looking forward to telling my parents; I'm not into awkwardness &amp; lectures.
					</section>
					<section class="t31">
						In case you're one of those people like p1 who think people aren't together until they kiss, I have one, sophisticated thing to say to you: forget you. Personally, I don't know who the dummy was that decided swapping spit is one of the best ways to show affection, but I can tell you it's dumb. I'm glad p63 isn't one of those people. However, I'm not stubborn enough to deny the meaning our society has put into a kiss, &amp; it would be a shame if I could never show p63 that she means that much to me, so I think, on a rare occasion when everything's perfect (&amp; private), I might demonstrate that. Not any time soon, though.

						Wednesday, December 25, 2013

					<section>
						It's Christmas! As I've done for as long as I can remember, I got up bright &amp; early so not even a moment of the excitement of the most enjoyable holiday was squandered. Also for as long as I can remember, my parents took their sweet time getting downstairs so we could open presents (they never let me wake them up until 9:00). However, this excruciating wait gave me plenty of time to text p63. She was actually the one who made sure I was up by 7:00 like I pretty much always am on Christmas &amp; only on Christmas (I was sort-of already awake, but I didn't know that it was time to jump out of bed).
					</section>
					<section class="t30">
						It was finally time for p63 to open her present from me (&amp; for me to eat my chocolate from her although I haven't yet). Inside the mysterious package was 10 pieces or origami: a flapping swan, a mouth that opens &amp; closes, an inflatable box/cube, a fancy box, an inflatable frog, a jumping frog, a gliding paper airplane, <span class="elaborate">a super fast paper airplane</span>, a bowtie-looking thing, &amp; an octagon thing that can collapse down into something that looks like an 8-pointed ninja star or a sun (which I think is the coolest).
						<aside data-heading="Extra information">
							This is my own creation, &amp; it led me to victory in my 8<sup>th</sup> grade paper airplane flight distance contest.
						</aside>
						<span class="t8">But that's not all; possibly the best part (&amp; most certainly the sweetest) was the note I left her. It said (in code, of course), "For the one who brightens my day 10-fold: May you have a very merry Christmas!"</span> Knowing p63 has a younger sister who could get jealous, I added one last thing. Inside of a smaller package with a Christmas tree drawn on the outside was a bowtie-looking thing, a flapping swan, a mouth that opens &amp; closes, &amp; a smaller gliding paper airplane. p72 was said to have acted like I made her a diamond when she opened it. <span class="t18">I'd say I did a pretty good job, wouldn't you?</span>
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2025/1/9">
						I feel like it's worth reminding you that I gave p63 this Christmas present before we were officially together.
					</section>
					<section class="t31">
						After thanking me for my gift &amp; saying how sweet I am, p63 said how she doesn't want to make me strain to compliment her but that just "thank you" doesn't seem like enough for all the nice things I say. I told her it's okay just as long as she reminds me every once in a while. I <em>really</em> enjoy flattering her into a loss for words; brightening her day just brightens mine all the more. If you wanted to use the words of p38, I suppose you could say that I really enjoy firting with her, &amp; actually, I guess I'm used to the idea enough &amp; I certainly like her enough that, if you said that, I probably wouldn't have much of a problem with it. To be honest, I think I enjoyed texting with p63 more than the rest of Christmas. That's not to say the rest of Christmas was bad, just that it was average &amp; I think of p63 as the perfect gift <span class="t18">(I'm good at this flattering stuff)</span>.
					</section>
					<section data-coolness="1">
						However, one gift (meant to go along with another) particularly stood out. For years, I've had these 2 games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin">Pikmin &amp; Pikmin 2</a>. On a very basic level, they're about a person / people from another planet who is/are very small &amp; come(s) to a "strange" planet (Earth) (there was one person in Pikmin 1 &amp; 2 people in Pikmin 2). In the process of trying to accomplish whatever they're there for, they come across these half plant half animal creatures called pikmin which each have special abilities. These pikmin help the person/people, &amp; (if you're good at the game) whatever it was gets accomplished. Pikmin 3 had been in the process of coming out for much longer than it should take any game to come out (9 years from when Pikmin 2 came out; Pikmin 1 to Pikmin 2 was 3 years). Originally, it was supposed to come out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> (unlike the past 2 which were for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube">Game Cube</a>). Later, it was changed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U">Wii U</a>. The Wii U was a yet-to-be-released game system with a touchscreen controller with all sorts of other buttons &amp; capabilities to go along with the console. Under the tree with my name on it was a somewhat heavy, medium-large box which, wouldn't you know it, had a Wii U. Who would have guessed that the present that looked like a videogame case was Pikmin 3. That must have cost something like $<span data-currency="USD">400</span>. I wasn't getting my hopes up for getting that for Christmas due to the cost. Although we are no longer on the verge of forclosure, we still don't have a bunch of money to throw around. Recently, though, we had a mentionable influx of money.
					</section>
					<section>
						Before we moved to our current house, we were extremely close to getting a trailer. We were strung along for a long time, &amp; they ended up dropping the contract due to title issues. It was a miracle we ended up finding this house to move into &amp; sold our house days before we would have been foreclosed on. Since p1 is a real estate agent, he hears about things that happen with houses. This past summer, p1 saw that the trailer had come back on the market. The price was less than it was before, &amp; p1 couldn't resist buying it when the price went even lower. We went there &amp; worked on it a whole bunch &amp; eventually sold it to make a pretty good profit. I find it quite ironic how, when we needed that house, we couldn't get it &amp; instead stumbled across a better one &amp;, when it didn't matter if we got it, we got it anyway &amp; made money off of it.
					</section>
					<section>
						It had crossed my mind that this extra money could increase my chances of getting a Wii U &amp; Pikmin 3, &amp; when I accidentally saw a previous page on p2's school iPod about the prices of the Wii U &amp; Pikmin 3, it especially raised my suspicions. I really liked the present, though, &amp; Christmas was awesome (as if there's another type of Christmas).

						In case you're wondering, no, this is not when I broke the news about p63 to my parents; that was the day after Christmas. As hard as it may be for you to believe, I have a life other than writing in here. A bunch of things have been happening which, as you might have guessed, are, of course, related to p63. It'll take me a while to get through them.
					</section>
					<section>
						Before I do any of that, though, I have to correct something because I can't stand wrong information being in here, but I won't go back &amp; fix it because it would be contrary to how I interpreted it / felt &amp; how I therefore acted/commented. Earlier I said how it turns out p63 hadn't had a boyfriend before me either; she had 2 before me. Apparently it's jumping to conclusions when I hear things like "no one's ever treated me like this before" &amp; "I have no idea what other boyfriends say to their girlfriends" &amp; assume she didn't have a boyfriend before. I don't have a problem with her having had a boyfriend before (&amp; it would be ridiculous if I did); it just wouldn't have hurt to be a little more clear. She says they weren't the greatest boyfriends &amp; she doesn't know why she went out with them. <span class="h1">That sounds so thought-out.</span> I'd be curious to learn more about these boyfriends who were mostly out just to find someone to title as their girlfriend <span class="elaborate">(as I am about pretty much everything)</span>, but I can survive on the current amount of information (don't worry, I'm not trying to find them to beat them up or something ridiculous).
						<aside class="reflection" data-heading="Clarification" data-date="2024/5/4">

					<section class="t27">
						Anyway, this entry is supposed to be about the things I said at the beginning. I'll start with the event that left me the most terror stricken: telling my parents that I have a girlfriend. When I was determining how long I could get away with <span class="elaborate">it</span> on a good conscience, the amount of minutes I had left on my phone came into account.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Clarification" data-date="2024/5/8">Not telling my parents that p63 is now my girlfriend.</aside>
						I knew that, if I had to ask for another minutes card because I had run out of minutes instead of days, there would be some questions raised. p63 &amp; I text <em>a lot</em> <span class="elaborate">when we don't call on the home phone</span>, so my minutes weren't going to last long.
						<aside data-heading="Extra information">Especially since it was before we started calling</aside>
						After Christmas, I had something pathetic like 9 minutes left. After due consideration, I decided to tell my parents the day after Christmas. I really didn't want to say anything before Christmas because I knew that at least p1 would feel the need to tell every relative he came into contact with.
					</section>
					<section class="t12">
						Because I'm really bad at improvising in unbearably awkward situations, I more or less keep scripts of what I'm going to say in my head usually with alternatives for the various ways the conversation could unfold. Naturally, the actual conversation is rarely without discrepancies to my imagined conversation. It doesn't go over well, but I can usually stagger through; I'm not going to put myself through awkwardness &amp; accomplish nothing because I didn't finish. Telling my parents was no different. I waited for a long enough silence to try to start, but p2 kept futilely attempting to begin a conversation. Eventually, I got around to it.
					</section>
					<section class="t12 t25">
						It was short, simple, &amp; to the point. The initial response was surprise &amp;, "Really?!" P1 asked if I was sure that she's my girlfriend &amp; not a girl that's a friend. You can't see me rolling my eyes right now. It turns out that he can accept I have a girlfriend without kissing her, but I know I'm not imagining his comment which stated otherwise. Completely contrary to what I had expected, the conversation was quite short, &amp; I managed to get out of it with next to no jokes being directed at me.
					</section>
					<section>
						While in total disbelief &amp; relief, I asked if I could play Pikmin 3 to give myself something to do (I made sure the controller was charged before I started the conversation). I could &amp; tried to immerse myself in the game, but I couldn't because it turns out that it needed an hour to update before it played the game. On the bright side, I could immerse myself in complaining about the Wii U.
					</section>
					<section class="t27">
						The next day, we went to the store &amp; (along with other things), got a new minutes card. It was 200 minutes which was turned into 600 minutes by my triple-minutes phone. Although I'm not particularly proud to admit it, 9 days later, I was down to 500 minutes. Since I don't think I said this earlier, each text uses 0.3 of a minute (that's not even a full third). ... We now call on the home phone nearly every day, so I restrain myself from texting much regularly, &amp; my minute consumption has gone down (p63, of course, has unlimited minutes). A drawback of calling, though, is that she can only talk for an hour, she can't talk after 8:00 on a school night &amp; 9:00 on any other, &amp; there's always either someone already on the phone or someone who calls while <em>we're</em> on the phone (that problem is still on her side; her family must be really popular). As you can imagine, my parents were the main inspiration behind calling instead.
					</section>
					<section class="reflection" data-date="2024/5/9">
						As I've reflected upon this last paragraph, I started to wonder why I didn't just use our home phone to call p63's cellphone which wouldn't be in nearly as much demand as her home phone and yet wouldn't run out of minutes like my cellphone would've. I can't be sure if I'm remembering correctly anymore, but I think the issue was that we would've been charged for calls from the home phone that weren't local, and only p63's home phone shared the necessary first 6 digits (the area code plus the next 3). Aren't home phones fun?
					</section>
					<section>
						Even though I excaped being made fun of by my parents at first, p1 soon settled into a pattern of cracking jokes to try to embarrass me. It's not as much as it could be, but I'm more sensitive to stuff like that &amp; could do without it. p63 talks about what her parents do to her, &amp; I'd be horrified. She says she doesn't mind it too much, but I don't know how much of that I could take. <span class="person p75">Her mom</span> found out about me at our winter band concert (she plays the clarinet, &amp; in case you forgot, I play the French horn). I don't know if that really counts, though, because it was a little over a week before we were officially together. <span class="person p75">Her mom</span> told <span class="person p76">her dad</span> when they got home. P2 also saw p63 there, but I didn't say much about it, &amp; just because I'm talking to a girl, it doesn't mean she's my girlfriend (although, to be honest, she might as well have been). Anyway, I'm still alive with my parents knowing I'm now with p63.
					</section>
					<section>
						I knew it would only be a matter of time until I had to meet p63's parents &amp; until my parents had to meet her. You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to schedule something that works for her parents; you get a "maybe" for something that's days away &amp; don't actually know the answer until a few hours beforehand which usually turns out to be a "no". I just wanted to get all of that meeting out of the way once I worked up enough courage, but it was extremely difficult.
					</section>
					<section>
						On Monday (a week ago), it was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, &amp; the day finally worked for the most part (p76 wasn't there, even though one day he was turned down because he wouldn't be there). Reluctantly, I thought things would be better done all at once, so my parents went to her house as well. p63's house is pretty small. <span class="t3">I stood around awkwardly a whole lot, but my parents kept a conversation going with p75 the whole time.</span> Eventually, I went to her room to dominate her at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero">Guitar Hero</a> (it's still a work in progress). <span class="t13">I brought along my juggling balls to show off my awesome juggling skills too. I was pretty entertaining if I do say so myself.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Our parents were in the other room, but p72 was with us most of the time. She was on the brink of being too hyper plenty of times, but there wasn't a crisis. I don't know why, but I don't have much of a problem being around her (let me explain what I mean). Normally, when I'm around people I don't know extremely well (like <span class="person p75">p63's mom</span>), I get really quiet. Even when some of them <em>are</em> people I know extremely well, I get quiet, just to a lesser extent. p72 just doesn't really seem to affect me. Maybe it's because I'm less scared of being judged, but I don't particularly expect other people to judge me. Maybe I've grown up with a mentality that it's okay to not put as much effort into not offending younger people, but it's not like I'm actually okay with offending anyone. Maybe I don't think she'd be able to understand my quietness, so I push it more to the side, but I wouldn't find it hard to believe that she thought it made about as much sense as I think it does (which isn't much). I don't get it. You might think that I should know the reasoning behind the things I do, but think about it this way: Can you tell me why you like your favorite color? <span class="elaborate obvious">My favorite color</span> Neither can I.
						<aside data-heading="My favorite color">
							Mine is just vibrant colors in general. Lime green tends to have the vibrancy I like, but I like more colors than that.
						</aside>

					<section class="t17 t31">
						Anyway, we left p63's house after a while, &amp; everyone seemed happy. She later texted me asking if my parents approved of her; I'd say they do. We ended up texting for a while, of course, &amp; I had finally been worn down enough. I decided I'd be the one who took the leap of faith, &amp; I said that I love her. ... p63 said how she was waiting for me to say that &amp; would have said it herself soon. I was tired of using "like" in place of "love" when I so obviously love her. I really do love her. I love her so, so, so very much. I love her with all of my heart &amp; every fiber of my body. She truly means the world to me, &amp; I don't say that lightly. <span class="t28">Saying all of that leads me back to the dilemma of my previous thoughts of how ridiculous people can be. I'm sure that this won't be the last time I feel that way, but I need to keep this entry moving.</span>
					</section>
					<section class="t12">
						After saying that I love p63 through a text, I thought I ought to say it at least once in person. On Wednesday, we were back at school. I waited until we were just about to part ways in the hallway &amp; then I barely mumbled out the words. Moments before I sprinted off to my class, p63 said in a perfectly audible &amp; confident way, "I love you too." I later asked her how she could say it so easily, &amp; she said how she's just confident in the way she feels. I'm confident too, but geez, I wish <em>I</em> could be that comfortable.
					</section>
					<section class="t7 t12">
						The next day in band, the teachers were gone which means a free hour &amp; a half with the substitute. I got a seat next to p63, &amp; we started a conversation. The important part, though, was later. Out of nowhere, <span class="p0">someone sitting close to us</span> turned around &amp; asked, "You two are dating, right?" I nodded &amp; then she turned around &amp; said, "See? I told you!" She also turned back around to say how we're cute together. One time before we were together, p38 said <span class="elaborate">the same thing</span>,<aside data-heading="Clarification" data-date="2025/1/5">"You're cute together."</aside> &amp; it was <em>really</em> awkward. p38 knows now because p63 apparently nodded her head when asked if we were dating soon after winter break while I wasn't around. Back in band, I was soon asked by <span class="p0">another person</span> if p63 was my girlfriend &amp; how long we had been together. I didn't really get past nodding. I feel bad for not answering the rest because it was asked in a way so careful not to embarrass me, but I'm not good at making decisions when I feel awkward.
					</section>
					<section class="t12 t22 t28">
						Until that point, I was wondering if everyone I knew was oblivious to how p63 &amp; I are inseparable; p63's friends knew, but they'd bug her about it all the time. The people in my grade on the other hand, were completely silent. As time passed, my suspicion that they hadn't noticed grew. In my mind, there were 2 paths people might take when they acquired the information:
						<ol>
							<li>
								The moment someone who knows me finds out, it spreads like wildfire, &amp; I never have another peaceful day at school again.
							</li>
							<li>
								Pretty much no one says anything, &amp; it spreads behind the scenes.
							</li>
						</ol>
						I didn't expect much in between, &amp; I seriously doubted the second option. The most likely reason I could think of as to why no one had said anything yet was that no one that knows me had found out. To my great surprise, the second option is the one that actually came to pass. I guess people respect my shyness a whole lot more than I thought. When I think about all of the people being nice &amp; not making fun of me, I think that they shouldn't have to be so careful around me &amp; that it wouldn't be the end of the world if they talked to me about it. Right after thinking that, I think about how easily I feel awkward &amp; that maybe I ought to rethink saying it's okay to talk about it. I wish I wouldn't make people scared of saying the wrong thing &amp; making me feel awkward. Deep down, I kind-of do want to talk about p63 (which is what I do here), but I have this hyperactive, uncontrollable feeling of awkwardness, &amp; I end up giving merit to people's fears. If I had the ability to turn off all of my awkward feelings, I would do so in a heartbeat without a second thought. I hate it, &amp; there's absolutely no way this is the last time you'll hear about it.
					</section>
					<section class="t12 t32">
						The last major, recent event is p63 coming to my house yesterday. Since I had been to her house, it only makes sense that she come to my house. Confirming the visit was once again difficult &amp; late. Eventually, she made her way to our excessively cluttered house (my room is quite organized &amp; is easily the most spacious room in the whole house... it's sad). P75 left after she dropped her off, &amp; my parents talked to her like they'd never talked to her before (which they hadn't much). Luckily, it wasn't about anything awkward. When their conversation ran out of steam, I was prompted to start talking. Because I'm ridiculous &amp; felt kind-of awkward, I didn't really say much. I started bringing stuff down from my room because that's where all the cool stuff is, &amp; after a little while, p63 came up.
					</section>
					<section class="t13" data-coolness="2">
						One trip to my room pretty much tells you exactly what kind of person I am: Coming in through my door is the end of a previously strung up can phone system that isn't quite completely dismantled. I have Nerf balls, golf balls, ping pong balls, basketballs, &amp; a soccer ball, all of which are almost exclusively used for juggling. I have two Rubik's cubes, one of which is broken from dropping it while juggling it. On my desk (other than the broken Rubik's cube) is a periodic table &amp; a failed attempt to run a small light bulb on bacteria in cups of mud. The inside of my desk contains small pieces of rope I made out of grass, tree bark, dog hair, &amp; strands off of leaves of a yucca plant. On my dresser is my hair in a ball to eventually get my DNA from &amp; my hair laid out in a strip to eventually make rope out of (p63 thinks it's gross. I would have finished making the rope, but hair doesn't stick together too well). The head side of my bed has a neon "open" sign, a foam Lego castle, a codes &amp; cryptograms book, &amp; an origami mouth made out of wrapping paper that's big enough to comfortably eat someone's head. <span class="t32">My video games are in alphabetical order, &amp; I have Popular Science magazines ordered by date.</span> I have copper wire from a dismantled computer, a slinky, really strong magnets, &amp; so much more. There was a whole lot to show p63, &amp; there's still some left.
					</section>
					<section class="t12 t31">
						After going through tons of stuff, I sat down on my bed &amp; p63 soon followed. Some of it could have been due to sinking in the bed, but she sat as close to me as you can without sitting on me. I had said days earlier that I could likely fight through my awkwardness to hold her hand &amp; said how it would be helpful if she made the first move. I thought she'd hold out her hand, but apparently not. I waited for long enough silence to get myself to put my hand out, &amp; in that time, p63 said some stuff. Somewhere along the line, she slipped in how she felt nervous (I wonder why). She also ended up talking about <span class="p0" data-revisit="name">her friend</span> who abruptly hugged me involuntarily one day. She said how she's sorry for how awkward her friend made me feel &amp; that's why she tries not to hug me. I decided I had waited long enough &amp; put my hand out. We held hands for a pretty good amount of time, &amp; I can't say that I didn't like it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Later, we went downstairs (not holding hands) &amp; were getting ready for her to leave. My parents invited her to stay for dinner, &amp; she ended up getting permission. Before we ate, I showed p63 how awesome Pikmin 3 is &amp; put it on 2 player. She wasn't too bad for never having played the game before; she might even be as good or better than p2 at the other Pikmins (but then again, who isn't?). There wasn't anything particularly interesting about dinner other than that it was a whole lot more formal than usual.
					</section>
					<section class="t10">
						It wasn't all that long after dinner until p63 had to leave. P75 came to the door to get her &amp; they made their way back to their car. As they left, p1 prompted me to walk her to her car; he said how it's what boys do. I told him how ridiculous it was, how the car was only a few feet away, how I wouldn't have much to say, &amp; especially how p75 was there. He kept insisting, but I would have been mortified to walk her to the car, so I stood my ground &amp; won. For the record, I walk p63 to her bus every day, but that's not quite as awkward. <span class="elaborate obvious">Origin story</span>
						<aside data-heading="Origin story">
							It started before we were together with a conversation like this: "Well, I guess I need to go now unless you want to follow me to my bus." I stopped walking towards my bus, hesitated, &amp; slowly made my way to the direction of hers. "Really!? ... People are going to start thinking we're dating."
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="t12 t24 t25">
						Once p63 was gone, not much else was said about her, &amp; I thought I might actually survive it ... pfft, whatever. I was so close; I was on my way to bed, but p1 stopped me after saying good-night &amp; had to give me a lecture. In short, it was about how I needed to change to have a closer (physically) relationship, so she doesn't think I think of her as just a friend &amp; I get dumped. I wasn't required to say much, but it made me feel horrible once again about the problem you must be all too familiar with by now. I've told p63 about it numerous times, &amp; she keeps telling me how it's fine &amp; doesn't really bother her, &amp; I believe her, but I still feel bad. It's so dumb when I'm the cause of my own problems, &amp; I just wish I could turn it off... Well, that's all.

						Thursday, February 13, 2014
					</h2>
					<section>
						The time has finally come; tomorrow is Valentine's Day. <span class="t33">I guess I can slack off more than I realize because I planned on getting a whole lot more entries in before this time. As it started getting close, I thought I'd settle for at least getting in an entry about my problems with religion, but it just didn't happen.</span> <span class="t20 t34">Just so you know, I really, <em>really</em> don't want to talk about my problems with religion; I'll go more in-depth in my actual entry, but you're lucky I'm even going to write it in here at all.</span> I think I'm going to have to give p63 back this journal once I write that entry.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, I wish I had more time to finish this up before I gave it to p63, but that's the way it goes. I've heard stories of snow for tomorrow which, if it was a snow day, would give me more time, but a Friday Valentine's Day is too perfect, &amp; I'll have to kill someone if it gets snowed out. I'm a big supporter of snow, but not for tomorrow. Since I can't tell the future, I'm going to write this entry like it's the last one before p63 reads this. I suppose you'll find out what happens in the next entry. Right now, I'll tell you what I plan on doing tomorrow.
					</section>
					<section class="t27">
						Chances are, the first thing I'll be doing is accepting p63's Valentine's gift she says she's been working on. We talk so much that it's a miracle if one of us can manage to completely keep a secret. My plans have leaked out as well; I've told her that I've been "writing something" &amp; that "she'll have to read it sometime". I've also told her I'm getting her a Valentine's present, &amp; on a different time, I've said how I have something that perfectly explains how long I've liked her that I'd give her eventually. Care to take a guess at what those things are?
					</section>
					<section class="t8 t30">
						I'm not wimping out at only this, though. At school, they sell things called candy grams <a href="#Friday%2C%20February%2015%2C%202013" target="_self">which I've previously mentioned</a>. I got a heart-shaped sucker, &amp; the note accompanying it reads in code, of course, "I thought I'd give you an edible representation of what you've had for months. I hope you love it as much as I love you." I would have added, "May you never be without a Valentine again." but I didn't have time before I needed to give it to the collectors. I'm going to give her the 2 notebooks this journal resides in along with an encoded note explaining them right before she gets on the bus to leave; I don't want her to have time to talk to me about it.
					</section>
					<section class="t31">
						However, I don't think the Valentine's gifts stop there.... I've turned this idea over in my head for a while now, &amp; I think I'll follow through.... Moments before I bolt off to my bus (the bolting is because of the next part), I think I'll ask her not to move &amp; ... I'll lean in &amp; kiss her. Not any of that wimpy on the cheek or forehead stuff, on the lips. I would have preferred to work my way up to this point, but if I don't use Valentine's Day as motivation, I don't know how long it'll be. ... Just thinking about it nearly gives me a heart attack; I can only imagine what it will be like in the moment. In the note explaining stuff, I put how, "the kiss was totally worth it" at the end, so if I started getting cold feet, I could think how it's already written down as if it happened, so it's too late to turn back. For the record, I still stand by what I said earlier about swapping spit being gross, but I also still stand by wanting p63 to know she means that much to me.
					</section>
					<section class="t23 t31">
						There's more reasoning behind not wanting to kiss p63 too often, though, other than it being gross and passing-out provoking. The way I see it, if you do it too much, it doesn't mean much of anything. Holding hands &amp; hugging I wouldn't have much of a problem getting used to, but it's like in band: if you play loudly all the time, people aren't as impressed by it. The same goes for saying that I love her; although it's true beyond a shadow of a doubt, if it's said all the time, it loses its meaning. I think that part has been going fairly well, but I wish p63 wouldn't say "love you" every time she texts me good-night like she's done for awhile now (she's waning off). I see what I'm writing &amp; feel horrible, but I don't want "I love you" to mean as much as "good-night". I'd let her use it as much as she likes, but then I'd feel bad not to say "I love you too", &amp; then I'd be saying it as much as her. I never want to be unable to express how very, very much I love her.
					</section>
					<section class="t31">
						p63 has wondered what I'd be okay with because she doesn't want to make me feel too awkward. Making me feel awkward is an unavoidable consequence of interacting with me for an extended period of time, but some things are more okay with me than others. Holding hands &amp; hugging would be okay &amp; not resisted in private. In public, though (which is when anyone else is around), I'd have a hard time getting over how awkward it would be. I've thought about holding her hand for the last half of our trip to her bus, but her hand is never available. I've already told you about kissing, &amp; anything more is either overboard or not meant to be done until you're married.
					</section>
					<section>
						An interesting thing I've learned about p63 is that she has a journal as well (she doesn't call it a diary either). Naturally, I'd find it interesting to read, but I wouldn't dare ask her for it; she can keep her thoughts to herself if she wants, &amp; I wouldn't have a problem with that at all. I was thinking that she could write an entry in here if she wanted to; it might be interesting to have another point of view. She might have to get another notebook, though, because there's not many pages left. I'm always jealous of girls' handwriting, but I'm <em>not</em> jealous of p63's handwriting. It wouldn't really matter to me whether she wrote in here or not, but if she does, it would be nice to keep it in the same sort of format (including 3<sup>rd</sup> person in relation to me). I don't use "you" in reference to p63 because, even though I know she'll read it, so will tons of other people. Also, it's easier to talk about p63 when I'm not talking <em>to</em> her.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although I could go on for a very long time about the sort of stuff in this entry, I think this is a pretty good stopping point. So in conclusion, I love p63 so much, &amp; I couldn't imagine a better person to receive my journal for Valentine's Day.
