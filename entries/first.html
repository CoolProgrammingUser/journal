				This will recount every important event in my life from birth to the first time I shared this journal with someone (in 10<sup>th</sup> grade). Keep in mind that, although I've added some things and tried to reformat others, this was originally written completely in notebooks with no expectation of it being put into a website (at least not any time soon). I also didn't bother with putting paragraph breaks anywhere for a long time, so I just made up wherever I thought was a good spot (which is pretty much what I do now anyway). In case you don't glance over the <a href="../indicators.html" target="_self">Indicators</a> page first (which you should) or you don't know how to interpret what I said, the things I've added at a time later than the date shown at the beginning of the entry are indicated with an <span class="afterthought">afterthought</span> styling.

					<section>
						I was born at 4:00am on March 11, 1998. My parents are <span class="person p1" data-use="firstName"></span> and <span class="person p2" data-use="firstName"></span> <span class="person p1" data-use="lastName"></span> (p1.extra2 and p2.extra2), and we lived in St. Charles, Missouri for the first 8 years of my life. Our house was in a small group of 4 other houses in a quickly commercializing area. I remember, when <span class="p0">some old people</span> died of natural causes (I assume), their house was turned into a restaurant called <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thyme-out-cafe-cottleville-2">Thyme Out</a>. When I was 3, I started going to the <span class="elaborate">D.L.C.</span><aside data-heading="Acronym">Developmental Learning Center</aside> where p2 worked. (It was a type of pre-school.) Besides a single scene of me in a crib with the baby-sitter nearby, my memories begin around this time.
					</section>
					<section>
						One memory is when <span class="p0">the jokester of the class</span> decided that he was really hungry and that the 2 hot dogs he had wasn't enough. Multiple times, he raised his hand and asked for another hot dog, and each time, when asked if he had had his second hot dog already (the maximum allowed), he would reply “no” and get another hot dog. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span><aside data-heading="Explanation">Different people kept coming over to him, so he could keep the lie alive.</aside> I was shocked by how many times he was able to pull this off.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other major memory was when I first rode the bus, had a substitute bus driver, or both. There was <span class="p0">this girl</span> that was a few years older than me who also rode the bus and got off at the D.L.C. building with me. When we arrived, I got up and started to leave, but I noticed that she wasn't coming. She was talking to her friends, so I tried to get her attention, but it wasn't enough to get her attention mostly because I was too shy like I am now except now I'm a little less. I told the bus driver about it, but he didn't do much about it and eventually I got off the bus. A little while later the bus came back and dropped off the girl (I can't remember her name). She was upset, and she asked me why I didn't tell her to get off.

						Although there are bits and pieces of other memories from this time, one more I think might be of interest is one time when I was eating lunch with the class in <span class="elaborate">pre-K</span>. During this particular lunch, p2 happened to walk by, and when she did so, I enthusiastically greeted her with a "Hi <span class="person p2">Mommy</span>!" Immediately after doing so, the entire class including the teacher stared at me in silence for what felt like an eternity before going back to their business. It could've been that they were just staring at me for making a scene, but I was worried that they were thinking I was too old to be using a word like "Mommy", and I didn't want to take the chance, so from that point forward, I never referred to my parents as Mommy or Daddy again.
						<aside data-heading="Abbreviation">
							In case you couldn't figure it out, "pre-K" is short for "pre-Kindergarten" (although no one ever refered to it as that). It was the last of four stages that you went through as you grew up at the D.L.C..

						While I'm listing other largely insignificant memories, I'll tell you that there was another when I was younger, and I needed to use the bathroom, but before I could make it all the way to the door, a teacher grabbed me and changed my (dry) diaper. Since it didn't seem like I would be allowed to use the bathroom while I was there, from that point forward, I would only go to the bathroom before or after being at the D.L.C..
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, in 2005 (when I was going into 2<sup>nd</sup> grade) my mom started working at <a href="https://warren.fhsdschools.org/">Warren Elementary</a> (my elementary school), so I stopped being dropped off at the D.L.C. from the bus and started being driven to school. Just in case you're wondering, p1 worked at National Vendors (a vending machine manufacturer) but it didn't affect my life much so there's no point in writing about it. Throughout elementary school there was a pretty good amount of things of importance that happened.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing that happened is I learned to hate M.A.P. testing (Missouri Assessment Program), and wish I lived in Nebraska (<span class="elaborate">Nebraska Assessment Program</span>).
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							In case you don't get it, the joke is that, in Nebraska, I would be tested on napping.

						Another thing that <span class="h3">I think is important</span> is that I learned my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher p3's Ice Cream Oreo Cake recipe! <span class="afterthought elaborate" data-date="2023/1/9">(It was a whole ordeal.)</span>
						<aside class="afterthought t1" data-heading="Ordeal" data-date="2023/1/9">
							As an end of the year reward, p3 was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, p3 made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked p3 for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, p3 tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since p2 was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with p3 about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, p3 kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to p3 one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.
						</aside>
						Since it's so amazing, I'll put the recipe in <span class="elaborate">here</span> so it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
						<aside class="t2" data-heading="Recipe">
							<ol>
								<li>Crush up Oreos, and put them at the bottom of the container you want.</li>
								<li>Melt some butter and pour it on the Oreo crumbs to make sure the bottom is stiff.</li>
								<li>Melt some ice cream a little and put it on.</li>
								<li>Freeze it all.</li>
								<li>Put on a layer of fudge (we're wimpy and use chocolate syrup) and a layer of whipped cream.</li>
								<li>Crush up some more Oreos and sprinkle them on top.</li>

								Now I may have forgotten one or two small steps, but if you do only what I said, you'll be fine.

						Back to what I was saying earlier, something else that is <span class="h1">super important</span> from elementary school was when, in 5<sup>th</sup> grade, we learned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJJmQojcLM">pi song</a> (yes pi).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something that actually was important is a collection of things that happened. I know this may sound cocky, but, throughout most of elementary school, I believe I was maturing more to a middle school level (see where if sounds cocky) but not with only good qualities. I was beginning to act like early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> graders would act in school which isn't the most pleasant. Luckily for me, this happened before everyone actually was in early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, so it wasn't accepted. I think that, if people would have accepted the things I did like they would have in 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I wouldn't be nearly as well-mannered (I'm not saying I'm completely well-mannered) as I would have been, and my life could have turned out a lot differently. Sometimes I wonder if I just got really lucky having this happen to me, &amp; other times, I think it would have been inevitable. The world may never know.
					</section>
					<section>
						Another impact on my life was my Spectra (class for gifted students) teacher, p4. I was always pretty shy and didn't want to make myself too noticeable, but p4 made sure that changed. She would always force us to act in skits and try to participate in discussions. VERY slowly, I came out of my shell. I'm not saying I'm the most out-going person now, but I'm a lot more than I was (which still isn't much). Something good, though, is that, now, I can choose to be out-going, but don't expect me to do so without a good, specific reason. I'm a pretty (amount not attribute) reserved &amp; mild person.

						A final important event from my elementary school career was when I slept over at my friend p5's house for his birthday party. Before we went to bed there, we had cake and presents and did a few other things. When night came and everyone went to bed, not everyone could fall asleep immediately; I was one of those people. For a long time I couldn't fall asleep, and during that time, I heard a bunch of strange noises. It sounded like <span class="person p6">someone</span> got out of their sleeping bag, went down the steps, after a while caused a popping or hitting noise, then ran up the stairs and started breathing heavy. Soon afterwards, the person went back in their sleeping bag which was followed by what sounded like <span class="person p7">someone else</span> getting out of theirs for a short time and then getting back in. In the morning, everyone was awake and gathered around a small table having a discussion. I must not have missed much because nothing referred back to something I didn't hear. When I began listening, my friend, p6, started talking about that night.
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="person p6">He</span> said that he thought he heard a noise come from the basement so he went to check it out. Once he got there, he says he picked up the duct tape bat (yes, duct tape bat. It was pretty fat) and headed towards what he thought made the sound. Suddenly, the thing rushed out and he hit it with the bat. In the process, though, he says it scratched him. At this time he showed us what, if you looked REALLY hard and used your imagination a little, might look like a scratch. I couldn't tell what everyone else was thinking, but what I was thinking was that you could hardly even pass that off as a scratch, but you want us to believe that you got that from some strange, alien thing and that, just yesterday night (he told us this also), it was bleeding and somehow it magically healed to become this nearly non-existent, miniscule mark that you hold before us today. I didn't say anything about it because no one else was, and it didn't seem like he was lying about the rest of his story. He said that after that, he ran up the steps with it in pursuit (he might have said he knocked it back a few times or something) and then slammed and locked the door to where we were all sleeping. After that, he went back in his sleeping bag. Since we were all curious, he drew us a picture of the "alien". It looked small, had a big head, slits for a nose, and was gray.
					</section>
					<section>
						But that wasn't an end to the story-telling. When we were finished looking at the picture, p7 started saying what happened to him that same night. He said that he was awakened by the sound of p6 slamming the door and got up to see what was going on. He says that he looked out the window in the room and saw something really strange. Supposedly he saw a light post, (there wasn't one) a flying saucer above it, and a bunch of aliens on the ground. I can't remember his exact description of the aliens, I'm pretty sure they had red eyes or something was red, but I remember the distinct impression that p7's aliens and p6's alien descriptions didn't quite match. Despite the discrepancies, they didn't seem like they were lying, and I find it hard to believe, since their stories matched up with what I heard, that they would get up in the middle of the night and act it all out for anyone who might be listening with their eyes closed because they couldn't get to sleep. I'm not saying they couldn't have exaggerated a little something they saw into something ridiculous though. I'm sure you can see where this is going, but too bad! You're just going to have to suffer through it.
