				This will recount every important event in my life from birth to the first time I shared this journal with someone (in 10<sup>th</sup> grade). Keep in mind that, although I've added some things and tried to reformat others, this was originally written completely in notebooks with no expectation of it being put into a website (at least not any time soon). I also didn't bother with putting paragraph breaks anywhere for a long time, so I just made up wherever I thought was a good spot (which is pretty much what I do now anyway). In case you don't glance over the <a href="../indicators.html" target="_self">Indicators</a> page first (which you should) or you don't know how to interpret what I said, the things I've added at a time later than the date shown at the beginning of the entry are indicated with an <span class="afterthought">afterthought</span> styling, and <span class="elaborate">dotted underlines</span> and people's names are clickable.
				<aside data-heading="Seriously?">Did you really just click on that?</aside>
				Upon copying the content into this website, I tried to reword the introduction of my journal in the first entry since that was the one place I gave myself permission to make sure everything was relevant to my audience when it came time to publish (which I originally imagined to be in a book); however, as I got farther along in my copying efforts, I noticed the occasional reference back to the way the introduction was originally written, and I wasn't about to update every small reference to the way things were (assuming I'd be able to catch them all), and that level of revision bordered on rewriting my history anyway (since, for example, I may have decided to write about something I mentioned in the introduction because I forgot to do so elsewhere), so I brought back the original introduction. You'll probably find it interesting to read how I introduced my journal when I was 14, anyway. In case you're wondering (or will wonder), it's because of this type of problem that I also didn't cut and paste the events from my childhood into the correct order (since outlining first is for losers, and I didn't remember everything in order). I corrected the occasional spelling error (which I wouldn't have made in the first place if I had spellcheck or if English wasn't dumb), and I might've made a small revision if I thought something was unclear or hard-to-follow, but it's quite rare that I did anything at all (besides <span class="afterthought">add stuff</span>) because I didn't make many mistakes in the first place (in my opinion), and I wanted to keep as much of my original writing style in-tact as possible.

					<section>
						Hello, my name is Robert Tour Benson. I am writing this journal so that <span style="text-decoration:underline">when</span> I become famous for reasons you will soon see, people will know what happened to me leading up to it. Also, it will save me from needing to take forever writing an autobiography, &amp; I think the more casual &amp; conversational sort of tone will be more interesting than just boring facts. It's all true, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						First let me start by going over what has already happened. On March 11, 1998, I was born. I have red hair and freckles. I think my eyes look more bluish-green, but officially, they're blue. Also, just in case you see me in shorts &amp; notice something above the front of my right ankle &amp; wonder, "What happened?" Nothing happened. It's a red birthmark. My parents are p1.firstName p1.middleName p1.lastName and p2.firstName p2.middleName p2.lastName. I don't really have any siblings, but I'll get to that later. For 8 years of my life I grew up at <span class="elaborate">5314 Highway N, St. Charles, Missouri</span>.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							I was so specific with the address because I wanted it to be possible to track down the childhood home of the famous Robert Benson. I originally had the ZIP code written as well, but I erased it later because I thought it was excessive. (It doesn't even matter, anyway, because the city is more specific than the ZIP code in that part of the state.) This address rolled off my tongue very easily for many, many years because I had to recite it so frequently as a child, almost certainly so I could tell someone where I lived if I ever got lost.
						</aside>
						It was with a group of 4 other houses in a quickly commercializing area. I remember, when <span class="p0">some old people</span> died naturally, their house was turned into a restaurant called <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/thyme-out-cafe-cottleville-2">Thyme Out</a>. When I was 3 I was sent to the <span class="elaborate">D.L.C.</span><aside data-heading="Acronym">Developmental Learning Center</aside> to learn where p2 worked. (It was a type of pre-school.) Besides a single scene of me in a crib with the baby-sitter nearby, my memories begin around this time.
					</section>
					<section>
						One memory is when <span class="p0">the jokester of the class</span> decided that he was really hungry and that the 2 hot dogs he had wasn't enough. Multiple times, he raised his hand and asked for another hot dog, and each time, when asked if he had had his second hot dog already (the maximum allowed), he would reply "no" and get another hot dog. <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious" data-date="2018/6/18">Explanation</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Explanation" data-date="2018/6/18">
							Different people kept coming over to him, so he could keep the lie alive.
						</aside>
						I was shocked by how many times he was able to pull this off.
					</section>
					<section>
						My other major memory was when I first rode the bus, had a substitute bus driver, or both. There was <span class="p0">this girl</span> that was a few years older than me who also rode the bus and got off at the D.L.C. building with me. When we arrived, I got up and started to leave, but I noticed that she wasn't coming. She was talking to her friends, so I tried to get her attention, but it wasn't enough to get her attention mostly because I was too shy like I am now except now I'm a little less. I told the bus driver about it, but he didn't do much about it and eventually I got off the bus. A little while later the bus came back and dropped off the girl (I can't remember her name). She was upset, and she asked me why I didn't tell her to get off.
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						Although there are bits and pieces of other memories from this time, one more I think might be of interest is one time when I was eating lunch with the class in <span class="elaborate">pre-K</span>. During this particular lunch, p2 happened to walk by, and when she did so, I enthusiastically greeted her with a "Hi <span class="person p2">Mommy</span>!" Immediately after doing so, the entire class including the teacher stared at me in silence for what felt like an eternity before going back to their business. It could've been that they were just staring at me for making a scene, but I was worried that they were thinking I was too old to be using a word like "Mommy", and I didn't want to take the chance, so from that point forward, I never referred to my parents as Mommy or Daddy again.
						<aside data-heading="Abbreviation">
							In case you couldn't figure it out, "pre-K" is short for "pre-Kindergarten" (although no one ever refered to it as that). It was the last of four stages that you went through as you grew up at the D.L.C..
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/9">
						While I'm listing other largely insignificant memories, I'll tell you that there was another when I was younger, and I needed to use the bathroom, but before I could make it all the way to the door, a teacher grabbed me and changed my (dry) diaper. Since it didn't seem like I would be allowed to use the bathroom while I was there, from that point forward, I would only go to the bathroom before or after being at the D.L.C..
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, in 2005 (when I was going into 2<sup>nd</sup> grade) my mom started working at <a href="https://warren.fhsdschools.org/">Warren Elementary</a> (my elementary school), so I stopped being dropped off at the D.L.C. from the bus and started being driven to school. Just in case you're wondering, p1 worked at National Vendors (a vending machine manufacturer) but it didn't affect my life much so there's no point in writing about it. Throughout elementary school there was a pretty good amount of things of importance that happened.
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing that happened is I learned to hate M.A.P. testing (Missouri Assessment Program), and wish I lived in Nebraska (<span class="elaborate">Nebraska Assessment Program</span>).
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/13" data-heading="Explanation">
							In case you don't get it, the joke is that, in Nebraska, I would be tested on napping.

					<section id="iceCreamOreoCakeStory">
						Another thing that <span class="h3">I think is important</span> is that I learned my 4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher p3's Ice Cream Oreo Cake recipe! <span class="afterthought elaborate" data-date="2023/1/9">(It was a whole ordeal.)</span>
						<aside class="afterthought t1" data-heading="Ordeal" data-date="2023/1/9">
							As an end of the year reward, p3 was going to give us an Ice Cream Oreo Cake party if we could behave well enough to spell out a certain short phrase. (Every time we behaved well, another letter of the phrase would be written on the board, and every time we behaved badly, a letter would be erased.) As time went by, we weren't making very good progress towards getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, but plainly wanting to give us the party, p3 made it easier and easier for us to get a letter. However, much to the dismay of myself and others, certain dumb people who couldn't get their act together started acting worse and worse as the end of the year approached, so we never ended up getting our Ice Cream Oreo Cake party. Since I wasn't going to get any Ice Cream Oreo Cake in class, I asked p3 for the recipe so my parents could make it, but she told me how she would need to get the recipe from home or something, and after confirming that I'd be back next school year, she told me how she'd get me the recipe when I came back next year. Naturally, I would've much rather had the recipe before the summer, but whatever. Summer passes, and when I return to school, I'm ready to recieve the recipe. However, p3 tells me how she still needs to get it from home (which isn't particularly shocking at the very beginning of the year when she likely forgot about the recipe over the summer, but it's still annoying). Since p2 was working at the school and driving me there, I was in a unique position to have a little unstructured time before and after school, so I could regularly follow up with p3 about the recipe. Day after day, week after week, month after month, p3 kept forgetting the recipe and/or had some other reason why she couldn't get it to me yet. Although I don't remember it well enough to say with certainty anymore, I'm pretty sure I was asking her about this just about every day (or maybe I waited a little while when she said a particular time of year was busy), but I continued having no success. Towards the end of 5<sup>th</sup> grade, I was getting worried about ever getting the recipe because I definitely wouldn't be coming back the next year after I went to middle school, and as I expressed my concerns to p3 one day, she abruptly had me follow her to the principal's office where she grabbed a random piece of paper and wrote down the recipe from memory. I wondered why she didn't just do that in the first place, but I also suspected she didn't have the recipe memorized until I pestered her about it constantly (although I didn't tell her any of that). I was very happy to finally get the recipe, and although it was really irritating that other people in my class prevented me from having the Ice Cream Oreo Cake party, I suppose it all worked out in the end because I've since had much more Ice Cream Oreo Cake than I ever would've had at that one party.
						</aside>
						Since it's so amazing, I'll put the recipe in <span class="elaborate">here</span> so it can be enjoyed for generations to come.
						<aside class="t2" data-heading="Recipe">
							<ol>
								<li>Crush up Oreos, and put them at the bottom of the container you want.</li>
								<li>Melt some butter and pour it on the Oreo crumbs to make sure the bottom is stiff.</li>
								<li>Melt some ice cream a little and put it on.</li>
								<li>Freeze it all.</li>
								<li>Put on a layer of fudge (we're wimpy and use chocolate syrup) and a layer of whipped cream.</li>
								<li>Crush up some more Oreos and sprinkle them on top.</li>
							</ol>

								Now I may have forgotten one or two small steps, but if you do only what I said, you'll be fine.

						Back to what I was saying earlier, something else that is <span class="h1">super important</span> from elementary school was when, in 5<sup>th</sup> grade, we learned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJJmQojcLM">pi song</a> (yes pi).
					</section>
					<section>
						Something that actually was important is a collection of things that happened. I know this may sound cocky, but, throughout most of elementary school, I believe I was maturing more to a middle school level (see where if sounds cocky) but not with only good qualities. I was beginning to act like early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> graders would act in school which isn't the most pleasant. Luckily for me, this happened before everyone actually was in early 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, so it wasn't accepted. I think that, if people would have accepted the things I did like they would have in 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I wouldn't be nearly as well-mannered (I'm not saying I'm completely well-mannered) as I would have been, and my life could have turned out a lot differently. Sometimes I wonder if I just got really lucky having this happen to me, &amp; other times, I think it would have been inevitable. The world may never know.
					</section>
					<section class="t3">
						Another impact on my life was my Spectra (class for gifted students) teacher, p4. I was always pretty shy and didn't want to make myself too noticeable, but p4 made sure that changed. She would always force us to act in skits and try to participate in discussions. VERY slowly, I came out of my shell. I'm not saying I'm the most out-going person now, but I'm a lot more than I was (which still isn't much). Something good, though, is that, now, I can choose to be out-going, but don't expect me to do so without a good, specific reason. I'm a pretty (amount not attribute) reserved &amp; mild person.
					</section>
					<section id="alienEncounterStory">
						A final important event from my elementary school career was when I slept over at my friend p5's house for his birthday party. Before we went to bed there, we had cake and presents and did a few other things. When night came and everyone went to bed, not everyone could fall asleep immediately; I was one of those people. For a long time I couldn't fall asleep, and during that time, I heard a bunch of strange noises. It sounded like <span class="person p6 noindex">someone</span> got out of their sleeping bag, went down the steps, after a while caused a popping or hitting noise, then ran up the stairs and started breathing heavy. Soon afterwards, the person went back in their sleeping bag which was followed by what sounded like <span class="person p7 noindex">someone else</span> getting out of theirs for a short time and then getting back in. In the morning, everyone was awake and gathered around a small table having a discussion. I must not have missed much because nothing referred back to something I didn't hear. When I began listening, my friend, p6, started talking about that night.
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="person p6">He</span> said that he thought he heard a noise come from the basement so he went to check it out. Once he got there, he says he picked up the duct tape bat (yes, duct tape bat. It was pretty fat) and headed towards what he thought made the sound. Suddenly, the thing rushed out and he hit it with the bat. In the process, though, he says it scratched him. At this time he showed us what, if you looked REALLY hard and used your imagination a little, might look like a scratch. I couldn't tell what everyone else was thinking, but what I was thinking was that you could hardly even pass that off as a scratch, but you want us to believe that you got that from some strange, alien thing and that, just yesterday night (he told us this also), it was bleeding and somehow it magically healed to become this nearly non-existent, miniscule mark that you hold before us today. I didn't say anything about it because no one else was, and it didn't seem like he was lying about the rest of his story. He said that after that, he ran up the steps with it in pursuit (he might have said he knocked it back a few times or something) and then slammed and locked the door to where we were all sleeping. After that, he went back in his sleeping bag. Since we were all curious, he drew us a picture of the "alien". It looked small, had a big head, slits for a nose, and was gray.
					</section>
					<section>
						But that wasn't an end to the story-telling. When we were finished looking at the picture, p7 started saying what happened to him that same night. He said that he was awakened by the sound of p6 slamming the door and got up to see what was going on. He says that he looked out the window in the room and saw something really strange. Supposedly he saw a light post, (there wasn't one) a flying saucer above it, and a bunch of aliens on the ground. I can't remember his exact description of the aliens, I'm pretty sure they had red eyes or something was red, but I remember the distinct impression that p7's aliens and p6's alien descriptions didn't quite match. Despite the discrepancies, they didn't seem like they were lying, and I find it hard to believe, since their stories matched up with what I heard, that they would get up in the middle of the night and act it all out for anyone who might be listening with their eyes closed because they couldn't get to sleep. I'm not saying they couldn't have exaggerated a little something they saw into something ridiculous though. I'm sure you can see where this is going, but too bad! You're just going to have to suffer through it.
					</section>
					<section>
						After all of that, I think we stocked up on fake guns and then went on an all out alien hunt! As time went on, more and more people said they saw an alien. I think, somewhere along the line, p5 (whose sleepover it was) said that he thought aliens had come by before (not necessarily in his house). We also came up with color codes (like "code red" or "code blue") for what type of alien encounter we had so everyone could come and see for themselves. It never worked out which made sense to me because if you're yelling anything the alien is going to run away. So this went on for a long time and eventually everyone wanted to go inside to get a drink and "reload". I didn't really need to do all of that, so I stayed outside along with my friend, p8. As I was waiting, I wandered down the hill (p5's house was on a medium one), and p8 followed. When I looked around, I saw something that caught my eye: it was moving at a slow jog, was white, not much taller than me (now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I was 7, so I wasn't too tall), its head was blocked by the neighbor's deck, it was skinny, and had five fingers and three toes. It seemed that it was coming from the woods to the far side of the neighbor's house, so I rushed over there with surprising speed only to find that it was gone.
					</section>
					<section class="t4">
						I know what you're thinking, "This dude is crazy. Why should I listen to anything else he has to say?" but don't discredit everything else because of this one thing. I promise you this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. I'm not going to lie to you. As I was writing this memory I was thinking, "Gee, this sounds exactly like some fictional story that I'm making up," but I'm telling you it's not! You may say, "That was some guy in a costume," or "You must have remembered it wrong," or "You're just insane!" and you may be right (except for the last one), but I don't think so. One thing I hope you don't say though is that I actually am making this up to sound more interesting because <span class="h3">I don't lie</span>. I can only imagine what you're thinking now, "This guy really is crazy! First he says he saw an alien then he says he doesn't lie! What next!" You can think whatever you want, but if you went up to anyone that knows me well, they could tell you that I don't lie and, for that matter, that I don't say bad words either which is sadly becoming increasingly common for everyone around me. Really, if you asked someone that knows me well if I lie (since I've had this come up before), they would say something like, "Well... ya. I remember when he said..." and if I was around I would say, "I didn't say that I said..." then they would say, "Oh ya. That's right." If they didn't say all of that they would say, "Ya." If I asked them to come up with one time that I did they would say, "... um ... I don't know, but there's no way that you've never lied," probably what you're thinking, but they can't deny that I'm honest and don't say bad words without them lying themselves. <span class="t5">A good example is this: not too long ago I came up with this funny thing where I would take something of someone's and hide it under their chair. When they realized it was gone (which it was more funny if I gave it back to them before they realized it was missing), they would say something like, "Did you steal my ____?" and I would say, "I don't have your ____." Notice I'm not lying because I really don't have their whatever. Besides, I don't really think it's stealing, it's more like misplacing. If they were to say, "Did you misplace my ____?" I would say, "Why is it that you just naturally assume that I did something with your ____?" I won't answer the question directly because I won't directly lie about my answer.</span> Staying true to the not lying streak though, there are a VERY VERY VERY VERY few times (notice how many "very"s there are) where it might depend on what your definition of lying is. I know what you're thinking, "Ha! I finally got him!" but no. It was only like twice, and, once again, it just <span style="text-decoration:underline">might depend on what your definition of lying is</span>. You can take that however you like, but, either way, I think it's pretty good that, out of 14 years, there are only 2 times that lying is in question. Also, I need the denial. If I ever accepted it, I would feel absolutely horrible about myself. I already feel bad enough about myself as it is. The point is that I don't lie to people, &amp; you can count on that. I would appreciate it if people didn't bring it up because it's meaningless, &amp; I would rather not think about it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, back to the story that I'm NOT lying about. When everyone came back outside, I told them about what happened and it seemed like they believed me with the same intensity that I believed their "sightings" ("I'm not too sure I believe you, and who really cares anyway if it didn't happen to me"). Although we kept searching after that, I'm pretty sure no one saw anything else, and the enthusiasm was lost. Soon, parents started coming to pick their kids up, and, eventually, I had to go home as well. The worst part of this is that, a few years later, I finally got a straight answer from p8 (who was with me when I saw the thing) about if he remembered it. He said no. I can only assume it's the same with everyone else at the sleepover. That <em class="elaborate">really</em> stinks because, if there's a bunch of people who say the same thing happened, you might believe them. If there's only one person who says something happened, you're probably going to think they're crazy. I probably shouldn't blame you; it's easy to understand why you would think I'm crazy, but I promise you, like I said earlier, this is the only thing of questionable reality that has happened to me so far. Don't discredit everything else I say because of this.
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/11">
							This is the first time I specifically indicate italics in my journal (by using a <span style="text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-style:wavy">squiggly underline</span> in the notebook since actually writing in italics is too difficult), and I can see that the word was originally capitalized but then erased and replaced with the italic version. I don't specifically remember the thought process anymore, but I'm almost certain that I was dissatisfied with using capitalization to indicate emphasis because I've always thought of it as being too strong of an indicator, so when I started needing to use it repeatedly due to the limitations of how distinct I could make my handwriting look, I got fed up with it and decided to come up with a way of implementing my own variety of italics. Although I did use to use capitalization for emphasis more frequently earlier in my life, based on my memory and the almost complete lack of emphasizing capitalization from this point forward, I'd say that I had largely progressed past that point by this time, and it's pretty much a guarantee that a significant amount of the capitalization writen prior to this point would've been written as italic instead if I had (presumably) settled on the method of indication earlier. However, I don't want to assume that I know what would've been italicized and what would've remained capitalized, so I've left the text as-written.

					<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/11">
						In case you're wondering what I think of my alien encounter 10 and a half years later, I'll tell you that I definitely saw what I saw, but what exactly it was is anyone's guess. I've never been prone to drawing very unreasonable conclusions from my experiences, so when it comes to the idea that I was just a cute 7-year-old kid who let their imagination run away with them (which was obviously the opinion of my parents at the time), I throw that out right away. Although I still remember the incident (although not in nearly as much detail as this entry describes), I know better than to think my remaining memories are anything but what I've rehearsed in my head for years, so I can't go back to the original memory and try to extract any additional information while having the benefit of 17 additional years of experience. I'm not going to dismiss the idea that there's a totally reasonable explanation for what I saw, but my vision has worked just fine all my life, and I've never had a problem distinguishing an animal or person jogging up a hill from something more unusual; that was definitely something more unusual. That being said, had I witnessed this outside of the context of an alien hunt, I may have still thought it was strange and wondered about it for a little while, but I'm rather doubtful that I would've come to the conclusion that it was an alien. When it comes to my overall opinion on the existence of aliens, I think the universe is way too big for there to not be a single intelligent life form anywhere else, and if that life form knew about us, I'm sure it would be interested to learn more. Whether or not we've been visited by extraterrestrials is more debatable, and it's not uncommon that I think the accounts of alien encounters I hear about are just adults letting <em>their</em> imagination run away with them, but if the aliens had the technology to visit us, I wouldn't be particularly surprised to find out that they did. Wouldn't it be interesting if, at some point in the future, we made contact with an alien civilization which said that it did indeed visit us in secret in the past, and upon inspection of their logs, it was discovered that they stopped by Missouri 17 years ago and had a hard time completing their objectives because they were busy dodging a bunch of kids. Until such a time, however, I don't think we're going to get any closer to settling the dispute over exactly what I saw.

					<section>
						There are still a few other things that happened to me when I was in elementary school (I don't remember these all in order, this may or may not be corrected) <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/11">(Nope. Reordering this stuff isn't worth my time and energy.)</span>
					</section>
					<section id="jumpRopeForHeartStory">
						I can't believe I forgot about one of the best days in my life. Every year, the school would have a day of doing active activities such as jump roping, hula hooping (I can't remember for sure), and tug-of-war. One of the main events was the Jump Rope For Heart (which the day might have also been called). At that time, everyone who wanted to participate would get a jump rope and see who could jump the longest (maybe this wasn't a whole day thing because I'm pretty sure only one grade was in the gym at a time). In third grade I was doing great. People tripped up one by one until only me and one other person (p9) were left. After this went on for a while, slowly, people started cheering my name! The next thing I know, all of third grade is cheering for me! I actually feel bad for p9; it would really stink if I was jumping and everyone started cheering my competitor's name, but it's not like I wish it didn't happen. A while later, p9 finally slipped up and I was the champion! I didn't stop there though. The previous record was 14 minutes and something and I made <span class="elaborate">the record</span> 16 minutes and something! I went on so long that they made me move so they could start tug-of-war. Much later though, I was criticized for jumping too slow which I was jumping pretty slow, but I never had a chance to redeem myself because that was the last year they did the traditional Jump Rope For Heart. On a side note, I wish I could remember the seconds of my record &amp; the previous one like I did for a long time.

							I was purposefully vague with "the record" here because I wasn't sure exactly which record I broke: After I set "the record", the teacher(s) made a point of telling me that I set the district record rather than just the school record, but I could never believe that a third grader could out-jump a high schooler, so I always felt like I missed something. I tossed around the idea that I might've broken the record for all elementary schools in the district or something, but I never got any clarification.

						A last memory from my elementary school years (ironically not related to school) is of us moving to 12 Patriots Lane O'Fallon, Missouri on <span class="elaborate">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</span>.

							I left a space here presumably so I could fill in the exact date, but I never did. I ought to just figure out when the date was and fill it in. I'm rather confident that it was in second grade, though, which would correspond to when p2 started working at my elementary school and started driving me.

						At this new house, I was in a large neighborhood (Twin Chimneys) &amp; was by a lake. There was a decent amount of kids there which was a change from the small amount of people I used to live around with my one main friend, p10. <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious" data-date="2023/1/14">Extra information</span>
						<aside class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/14" data-heading="Extra information">
							This increase in kid-friendliness was the primary reason cited by my parents for moving. That, and the fact that p10 had recently moved away.
						</aside>
						He's usually the person I pick when I'm forced to pick a best friend; it's not that he's particularly better (or worse) than anyone else, but he was one of the people I used to know best &amp; I've just stuck with him, so I have something to say.

						p11.firstName (probably p11 because he's older by the time you read this) was the main person I knew at this new house; he's very curious, out-going, &amp; exaggerates a lot.

						Once we had moved here, p2 drove me to school through elementary school because she had recently gotten a job working there as a <span class="elaborate">para</span>. She still has that same job now (when I'm writing this).
						<aside data-heading="Description">
							This is short for "paraprofessional". Basically, she helps special needs kids.

						Also, somewhere around this time, p1 became a real estate agent which, again, he still is (same thing).

						When it was time for me to go to middle school, I went to the school district closer to where we lived. If you're paying attention, you'll have noticed that I'm referring to the house in the past tense, but I'm not there yet.

						Anyway, so starts my middle school years.
