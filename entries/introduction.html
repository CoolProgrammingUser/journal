				This is where the primary content of my journal is. If you haven't already done so, I encourage you to look at the <a href="../indicators">Indicators</a> section before continuing because it'll help you understand the strange coloring and outlining and stuff you'll see while reading.

				Everything up to a little past the second section was originally written in a grand total of 3 notebooks with the expectation that this journal would eventually be published in a book. I retrospectively added essentially all paragraph breaks and adapted the content to this website while preserving as much of the original intent as possible. There's a mixture of content written in-the-moment and written in reflection, but it isn't until early in the third section that in-the-moment content is created with the expectation of being put on a website. Somewhere at or beyond the third section I may make mention of recording entries since I discovered that I'm better at getting through large amounts of content when I record myself talking through it and then have a program transcribe it (and then I refine it).
