In case this is the first you'll hear about it, words with a dotted underline or encased in curly braces ({}) can be clicked on to show additional content. People's names can also be clicked on to make a pop-up appear with slightly more information, but I'd rather you didn't follow the link on the pop-up at this time.

						In case you're interested, there's a number of other things that happened yesterday:

						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="e36" data-revisit>

					<section>
						Wednesday was <span class="person p01"></span>'s birthday. As should be expected with anyone I grow so close to, I couldn't just let this special day pass by without doing something cool for her. Knowing that her favorite animal (and future animal of study) is a bat, I set out to make <span class="person p01"></span> an origami bat (which I could hopefully get to flap). After searching the Internet the day before, I came across a number of places which claimed to have instructions for making a flapping origami bat. I picked one and started folding it, but when I got to the end, although it flapped, it didn't really look much like a bat. Dissatisfied, I found different instructions which seemed to give me more of what I wanted and resolved to make it the next day. (It was too late for me to finish it that night.) When Wednesday arrived, <span class="elaborate">I tried to go especially fast through my morning routine</span><aside data-heading="Side-note">I've done this twice before, both times so I could try to finish my giant drawing for the following art class.</aside> so I could have 30 minutes before class to work on making the bat. Although I did get the 30 minutes, making the bat was a long process, so I ended up woking on it a little during class as well as a fair amount between classes. Once I was finished, though, I had a very realistic bat which flapped. I was ready to surprise <span class="person p01"></span>.

						When I walked in to Biology, I spotted <span class="person p01"></span> and noticed she was sitting in a different place. I was a little confused, but there was still an open seat next to her, so I promptly filled it. The proceeding conversation went something like this:

						As you might imagine, I was rather taken aback by this sudden display of hostility. Although I seemed to have smoothed things over, I didn't expect such a scenario to arise in what's otherwise a mutually enjoyable relationship. Right away, I suspected that there was more to <span class="person p01"></span>'s hostility than just tiredness. Furthermore, I suspected that I didn't have to look very far for the reason: As you know, I developed a friendly rivalry with <span class="person p01"></span>, similar to the one I had with <span class="person p03"></span>. Consequentially, it would be fairly common for me to dish out light-hearted insults. Aware of the potential to hurt her feelings by going to far, I was ever vigilant in my efforts to keep myself in check; however, it wouldn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that I messed up somewhere along the line or that, like <span class="person p03"></span>, she didn't let on that the insults were slowly taking their toll. It could be that her tiredness weakened her ability to keep things to herself and inspired her to seek refuge from what would ordinarily be _________________________________.

					<section>
						I've decided that I'm not going to mess around with trying to indicate my emotions in these planned entries because I might change how I classify things later, anyway, and it's clear that the lack of definitive completion in my emotion indication is preventing me from making progress. I always planned on proof-reading these entries before I added them to the main journal, so it's not like I'm really giving myself much more work to do later. I have no intention of getting rid of any way of people knowing the feelings with which I say something, but I need to have a fully-developed system before I try to start implementing it. Hopefully, things will be easier once I have a clear idea of how to do things; however, if that's not the case, I guess I'll have to devise a simpler way of indicating my emotions because this isn't working (but it's too valuable to eliminate completely). With any luck, I might start making some progress now.

						Wednesday, February 28, 2018
					</h2>
					<section>
						The first thing I'm sure you'll notice is that this date is prior to the one you just read (if you're someone who reads the dates). Ordinarily, I'd prefer to do things sequentially, but by the time I get around to typing all of that other stuff up, all of the interesting things that happened to me today would be old news. Since it's an especially inconvenient time for me to be recounting my day, I'm going to try to be brief. I'm just going to number things, so I don't have to spend time transitioning; everything will be numbered in order of increasing importance.
					</section>
					<ol start="7" reversed>
						<li>
							I did my laundry today. Things were a little more crowded than expected probably because the washing machine room was flooded over the weekend, and no one could do their laundry. In case I don't say it in something preceeding this, I chose Wednesdays to do my laundry because my classes end at 2:20, and my only class on Thursday starts at 1:30 (the same one that ends at 2:20).
						</li>
						<li>
							I saw <span class="person p02"></span> at dinner today, and I didn't even try to walk by and say "hi". Granted, I did get there late, she was finished eating, and she was especially far off in the corner, but I consider it a win nonetheless. That's not to say that I'm over the nonsense which I'm sure you're familiar with by now, but I think the decreased contact (as if there was ever much contact in the first place) is helping take some of the edge off. Occasionally, I run into her when she's a little extra dressed-up or maybe she doesn't completely ignore me, and I feel myself wanting to get a little too excited, but I think things are generally headed in the right direction.
						</li>
						<li>
							I had a Biology test today. As is typically the case, I somehow didn't manage to find the time to really study beforehand with the exception of a small amount of time immediately preceeding the test. As is also typical, I had difficulties finishing the test on time, but I don't think I did too badly. Maybe if I studied, the answers would come to me more quickly. (For the record, though, there aren't only frivolous reasons behind my failures to study.)
						</li>
						<li>
							My Chemistry class was canceled today. The reason behind it was that the professor was going to present his research later that day. He invited the class to come, and I actually decided to go. (What did you expect? I'm a nerd.) There were a number of professors there, but I'd say the vast majority was composed of students. It turns out that my professor is researching more cost-effective and versitile ways of creating carbon compounds. (I should have seen that one coming: what chemist isn't doing that?) It was moderately interesting and caused me to have to rush through lunch to get to my next class on time.
						</li>
						<li>
							My electric razor stopped working today for no apparent reason. Yesterday, it had run out of charge, so I plugged it in to charge over night. When I tried to use it today, however, it just wouldn't turn on. Sometimes it would do that the first time I turned it on after charging (still for no apparent reason), but it would always resolve itself. Such was not the case this time. In response, I put off all of the other necessary things I was going to do so I could order a new one. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to try to keep my rapidly-growing facial hair at bay with scissors. (Scissors are an awful thing to try to use as a replacement for an electric razor, particulary when you want a clean shave.)
						</li>  <!-- talk about Boys State -->
						<li>
							<span class="person p07"></span> finally convinced me to let him move into my room. It seems that he was having problems with his roommate keeping him up late with loud noises, and with upcoming tests and stuff, <span class="person p07"></span> was getting desperate. We had extensive talks about my reservations with him moving in, and I made sure to tell him how he needs to express his feelings to his roommate rather than stay silent, but over time, it seemed to me that <span class="person p07"></span> had made at least a mild attempt to bring up his concerns, and it also seemed that he's reasonably capable of not making me feel awkward at every waking moment. Eventually, I agreed, and although he was happy, he didn't get quite as celebratory as he might have otherwise, probably because he knew how seriously I was taking this. Preliminary results seem to suggest that things will be okay, but I think there has to be more than one day of evidence to work with before such a statement could be said conclusively. Regardless, things will be certainly be more interesting from here on out.
						</li>  <!-- I changed something above here. -->
						<li>
							I reached the top of Google. As I was looking through my emails today (which apparently aren't causing notifications to be sent to my phone), I noticed two emails saying something I'd never seen before: a number of people had visited one of my websites. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the wesite was the one where I talked about <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/canphonesandcorners/">getting can phones to go around corners</a>. Apparently, in December, 123 users visited my site, and in January, 250 users did. None of them were even me! The average time spent on my website was about 40 seconds, and they generally only looked once. What I found particularly interesting was that 70% or so came from "referral", meaning that there's apparently a fair number of links out there on other websites which people are following to my website. (Alternatively, there's one link on a moderately popular website.) <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious">Future</span>
							<aside data-heading="What I later learned" data-date="2023/1/11">
								I later learned that the referrals were indeed primarily coming from one moderately popular website which was made to give teachers ideas for activities. This also corresponds to how, over time, I would get more traffic during the school year than I would during the summer.
							</aside>
							Even more interesting was that greater than 25% of people came from an "organic search", meaning that they searched Google and found my website. Considering how, last time I checked, my website was so far away from the top of the results that I couldn't find it, this came as quite a surprise to me. Naturally, the first thing I did was search for "how to make can phones go around corners", and what do I see at the very top of the results but my website!!!! I have no idea how this could have happened, but I've obviously done something right in those four years I hardly did anything (the site was published on February 3, 2014). When you make it to the top of Google, you know you've made it in life. Suddenly, I have this compulsion to do some maintainence on my website, so I can give my followers a better experience. Who knows: maybe when I get this month's update<note-><div><div>I didn't get updates before, presumably because my website wasn't important enough.</div></div></note-> I'll have more than 300 users who visited the site! Some of you may think that the overall importance of this part of my day should have ranked below <span class="person p07"></span> moving in with me (or, in this case, above), but some of you would be wrong: Some people spend a lifetime trying to get to the top of Google but never achieve it (let's forget for a moment that Google isn't even a lifetime old); I, however, have beaten the odds and reached the pinnacle of Internet noteriety. For the forseeable future, <em>I</em> will be the authority on all things related to can phones and corners; <em>I</em> will be the go-to resource for solutions to <span class="elaborate">"string"ent</span> problems; and <em>I</em> will have influence over <em>hundreds</em> of people. My immortalization has already begun.
							<aside data-heading="Clarification">
								This is a play on words drawing attention to the "string" in the word "stringent" in order to make a connection between the string in can phones and the stringent problems people may be facing with them.

						Today was a rather unproductive day but fairly interesting. (Typing this doesn't help my productivity.) After waking up at 12:38pm, I went to breakfast and came back with the intent of working on some homework. However, remembering how I had started digitizing the things I need to write in this journal yesterday, I decided to finish it up (not counting things I hadn't written down yet). Hours later, I finally finished, and it was about time to go to dinner. I would have went right away, but I was delayed when one of <span class="person p07"></span>'s friends came over and <span class="person p07"></span> started giving me a bunch of Japanese food to try. (I also tried asking his friend what the proper way of saying "weirdo" is in Japanese to little success.) At dinner, who would I see but <span class="person p02"></span>. I had seen her sitting by herself in a corner a number of times now, and through all of those times, I resisted the urge to sit with her (especially since she would enevitably get up and leave soon after I sat with her since she didn't have much food left and didn't want to play on her phone while I was talking to her<note-><div><div>There have been many times when I would see her finished with her food, not sit with her, and yet when I'm leaving, see her still sitting there playing on her phone (not using it to talk to someone). However, any time I've sat with her (with the possible exception of the first or second time), she has promptly gotten up and left once she had finished eating. I think it's more of a not-wanting-to-waste-time-when-she's-being-held-accountable sort of thing as opposed to a wanting-to-get-away-from-me-as-soon-as-possible thing, but who really knows?</div></div></note->). This time, though, I saw that she had a decent amount of food left, and it had been quite some time since I had sat with her last<note-><div><div>Even if she's not interested in a relationship (which I don't even know if I am), I'd still consider us more or less friends, and I sit with the rest of my friends more than that. (It's been at least a month or two.)</div></div></note->, so I decided to drop by. We talked, and everything seemed to go pretty well: the conversation wasn't nearly as dead as it normally is, and she seemed pretty cheerful and giggly<note-><div><div>Once again, giggly isn't quite the right word: she was just laughing a lot.</div></div></note->. When she finished eating and started to leave, I told her, "What? you don't want to play on your phone while you're having a conversation with me?", and she knew it was the truth. I think I made it through the whole encounter without acquiring another massive crush on her. Since I then found myself alone in a corner, I moved my plate with the rest of my food towards the center of the dining hall so I could be closer to the action (which was basically non-existent). As I was finishing up, one of the girls who regularly works in the dining hall came over to me and started asking me questions about what I thought of the gospel and how my life fits into it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting my dinner to go in that direction, and although she was fairly nice (just like the rest of them), it was still pretty awkward. I don't know what inspired her to come over to me when she never did before for the whole year up to now. On my way back to my room, I decided to take the elevator, and I was joined by three girls acting in a goofy manner; I wouldn't have thought much of it if it weren't for the fairly pungent smell of alcohol eminating from them. When I finally made it back to my room, I started working on this but remembered that there was some homework I really wanted to fininsh so it would seem like I had actually accomplished something today. After getting a few problems of that done, my parents called, and there went about an hour and a half of my time. While talking to them, I tried to bring up the idea of letting me travel abroad for a semester, and probably because of the way I established a certain context and eased into it, they almost seemed to be in agreement (or at least p1 did; who knows what p2 thought considering how she didn't have much an opportunity to offer her opinion on the subject). Once I had escaped the conversation, I finished the assignment I had started and resolved to quickly add this entry so there could be another small glimpse into my daily life (despite the fact that there are other longer and more important things that I want to write about but don't have time for). However, considering how it's 12:57am<note-><div><div>The date is still from "yesterday".</div></div></note-> and I effectively started this almost two hours ago, I don't think I'm doing very well on the "quickly" part. I haven't even gotten ready for bed yet; the constant recurrence of situation can be quite frustrating.

						As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.
					</section>
					<section>
						I <strong>hate</strong> my addiction. I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between p03 and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). p03 is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

						Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the large number of my pants that were a little too tight for me. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span><aside>They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance. Luckily, I got some new pants this past summer or else even more of them would be a little too tight.</aside> If I were a girl, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the construction of my body, I'm predisposed to encountering issues. In particular, random (or non-random) fluctuations in my hormone levels are capable of producing an obstruction to comfortable sitting. With tighter pants, it's possible for that uncomfortableness to border on painfulness as happened on Tuesday. (This doesn't happen very often or else I would demand new pants from my parents.) Naturally, my corrupted mind saw this as an opportunity to entertain my addiction, but I'm not one to willingly torture myself, so I took measures to prevent it. Of those measures, the most effective one was a persuasive essay I had begun writing in an effort to call attention to my motivations for discontinuing this activity when I'm not thinking clearly. Even though it isn't finished, as has happened every other time I read it, my urges were replaced with intense disappointment for what my life had become. However, I still couldn't sit. In order to adequately rectify the situation, I had to go to the bathroom, but I ended up spending the majority of my time there crying. (I bet you were starting to think I did something else.) Luckily, the place was pretty deserted, so I didn't have to worry about anyone hearing me. I usually try to occupy my mind with more manageable thoughts, but this time, the full force of what a disgusting undisciplined disappointment I am really set in. For a good 20 minutes, I stood around in there thoroughly sobbing, banging my head against the side of the stall, and despairing over my future (and past and present). Eventually, though, I collected myself and attempted to be productive.
					</section>
					<section>
						Reading this, you may think that I should have been happy that I scored a victory, but the thing you overlook is that I've scored plenty of victories in the past, and yet the problem remains. I'd like to think that the persuasive essay I wrote will continue to keep my addiction at bay, but I have no way of being sure of that. I'm just so tired of being miserable; I want it to stop. If I could take some magical pill to put an end to my addiction, I'd do it in a heartbeat. More drastic than that, I've given some serious thought to, at some point in the future after having kids, effectively having myself neutered. I just hate this so much. It's been some time now since I decided that I may not be able to resolve this on my own, but who can I tell? My parents who will exacerbate the situation? My friends who will leave me? One of the many organizations established to help with such an addiction? Society has made it very clear that this isn't something that's okay to talk about, and I definitely feel the pressure to conform. The Internet, however, seems to have a completely different point-of-view. When you look up how to stop an addiction such as mine, you get two kinds of results: ones that tell you you don't need to stop, and ones that tell you you should just trust in God. As you might imagine, I don't find either of those results very helpful. Those results, though, suggest an entirely different distribution of opinions than I'm familiar with, and I'm skeptical of their accuracy. Even if 5% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad, I still want to stop for that other 95%; even if 25% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad and another 50% can accept me, there's still that other 25% and that 50% surely wouldn't think of me as being as virtuous as they thought before; even if 100% of the population suddenly decided that my addiction is rather insignificant, it would still be quite some time before I could move past the disgust that has been so thoroughly instilled in me. I can't give definite numbers to who will think what, but I don't think I have the greatest odds, especially among the people I get to know. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span>
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">Although I'm not saying other people are inferior or that I only associate with certain people, I do have a tendency to form stronger bonds with the type of people who are generally thought of as meeting higher academic and moral standards, but it's because they meet those standards that I'm worried that I'll no longer seem like the person they want to be around.</aside>
						As I contemplate giving this journal to my closest friends once it's finished, I'm worried about what will happen if this is still an issue: People may be able to look past something that affected me <em>in the past</em>, but what will they think if it's still going on? I'd like to have the previously written part of my journal digitized by the end of the summer and have the events since then caught up by winter break. That only gives me a limited window to resolve this, especially if I would need at least a month or so free from this to have any sort of certainty that it's gone. (I've gone about a year free from it before, so a month is an absolute minimum.) I just want this to be over. I'm so tired of feeling awful. I want my life back.

						<span class="person p07"></span> offered to pay for a trip to Japan for me today. Although he has invited me to stay with him in Japan on numerous occasions, this is the first time that he seemed to be serious about a proposal of my visit (or at least serious enough that he offered to pay when he saw that finances posed a significant hurdle). There are a number of things I could say on this topic, but my main purpose here was to get the date recorded for future reference; I don't really have time for anything else, especially considering how it's crunch-time for finishing the website for <span class="person p03"></span>. You can be sure that I'll be talking about this later, though.

						I finally finished the website for <span class="person p03"></span> (on Thursday). If you're paying attention, you'll notice that Thursday wasn't the day after <span class="person p03"></span>'s birthday (that would have been Monday). Despite significant determination, I just couldn't get it done on time. For nearly two weeks, I've been getting miserable sleep in an effort to get things done as soon as possible: the first week averaged out to something like 5 hours of sleep a night, and starting after I woke up on Sunday going through Thursday, I got a total of about 5 hours of sleep. I felt like I was back at Boston University. I thought for sure I'd crash and not be able to keep up the sleep deprivation long enough to finish the website, but somehow, my body adapted and allowed me to stay relatively awake throughout that time. A little after 9:00 Thursday night, I sent <span class="person p03"></span> texts consisting of the following:
					</section>
					<section style="padding: 0rem 10rem">
						"This is Robert Benson. I would appreciate it if you could go to this URL (preferably on a computer): https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/specialprojects/srt/bunnies. (There's an animation I made there.) I would also appreciate it if you could respond to this text at some point, so I could minimally know that you received it. It would mean a lot to me for you to see it, so I may make further attempts to cause such to be a reality."<br>
						...<br>
						"Also, happy late birthday. (I was supposed to tell you that in the first place.)"
					</section>
					<section>
						I spent a significant amount of time trying to convince myself that it didn't matter whether <span class="person p03"></span> saw the animation, and I was initially successful, but after killing myself trying to get it finished, I can't help but think that it <em>does</em> matter. I haven't heard back from her, so I sent her a short text today asking if she received my texts. Tomorrow, I'll ask <span class="person p09"></span> if she knows whether her number is still valid. If it's not, I still haven't deleted my Facebook account yet, and I know that <span class="person p03"></span> has an account, so that's where I'll go next. I'm reasonably convinced that I'll be able to contact her through some means. I was also reasonably convinced that she'd be willing to respond to me if I requested it, but if it turns out that her phone number still works, it would seem that I was mistaken. I think the animation has an excellent mix of humor and thoughtfulness, and if she would watch it, I think that there would be a good chance that she would be willing to entertain the notion of giving me another chance. She has to see it, though.

						There are a number of things I should be doing, especially since I've been doing almost nothing but programming for nearly two weeks, but I'm just exhausted, and I want someone to help relieve me of some of this stress; this is as close as I can get to that. My parents are going to call tonight, and I'm wondering what I'm going to tell them because, eventually, my dad will stop talking, and they'll want to know what I've been doing and whether I've rectified all of the things they're disappointed in. (No.) I'm going to have to think hard about what I did besides programming for <span class="person p03"></span> (which would be a terrible idea to tell them about) and then try to make it seem like that could have filled up my whole week. Luckily, they've convinced themselves that I rarely do anything productive, so it will be much more likely that they assume my lack of things to say about my week is an indication of how much time I've wasted rather than an indication of my reluctance to confide in them with my personal problems. I actually had a dream about my parents last night: It started off being more about me being held prisoner in my house and later shifted a little bit to my dad enforcing even more strict rules upon me and then leaving with my mom for a short time. In that time, I decided that the line had finally been crossed, and I coordinated an "escape" with my friends.<note-><div><div>They weren't really friends that you or I would know outside of the dream; they were just friends.</div></div></note-> I started packing up the most important stuff and loading it into my friend's car, but before I could get the last of my stuff, my parents came back and put an end to it. They treated me as if I was a little kid making an irrational decision to run away from home, and all I could think about was how I was all the more determined to get out of there the moment they left again. Even after waking up, the idea of escaping the condescension of my parents/dad and exploring the world in a car with my friends didn't seem too unappealing; however, I don't particularly expect it to happen. Tying things back into the original topic of this entry, I also had a dream about <span class="person p03"></span> last night: Somehow, <span class="person p03"></span> and I both ended up at a party thrown by <span class="person p09"></span> (which meant to me that her phone number was almost certainly still good). As I stood off to the side, I could hear <span class="person p03"></span> talking to a bunch of people about how she had had intimate relations with some guy, and presumably because she had gotten hooked, she had since then been entertaining an addiction much like my own. The tone was rather light-hearted. I wasn't sure how to feel about it then, and I still don't.
					</section>
					<section>
						I really messed up my relationship with <span class="person p03"></span>. The only person I've ever felt closer to is <span class="person p05"></span>, and that's just because I didn't make such an attempt to restrain myself as I did with <span class="person p03"></span>. Moreover, I don't think there's <em>anyone</em> who I've gotten along with better. (I'm sure you've heard this all before.) <span class="person p03"></span> is an exceptional person, and it pains me deeply that she's no longer in my life. I'm hoping that the website I made will help make things right, but there's no guaruntee of that, and I couldn't think much lesser of her for not being able to move on regardless. I guess only time will tell.

						In my attempt to find out where p06 lives, I stumbled across p012's house (who she's not related to). As it turns out, p012 lives in the same neighborhood as p05, if not the same street. (I don't remember exactly where p05 lives.) Moreover, he lives close enough to fairly easily walk to her house (based on my general knowledge of where it should be), and I surely passed by his house when going to p05's house. There must be more people I know who live nearby, but I still consider it pretty interesting.

						I finally started transferring my written journal onto this website yesterday. This has taken <em>way</em> too long. I got sick of waiting around for me to figure out how to make things just right, so I cut some corners, got to work on implementing it, and declared it good enough. There's still some stuff I need to add at some point, and there are a few things that I notice I need to refine when I'm transferring what I wrote, but I'm finally starting to make some progress (very slowly). I'm trying to clarify and expand things as I transfer them (while maintaining as much of the original content as I can), and it's already killing me. As is always the case, I have to find a balance between speed and thoroughness. It's not working very well so far. If you start looking at the dates of these entries, you'll notice that they aren't very sequential; my motivation to finish (or start) entries tends to drop off significantly once they lose their immediate relavence, and it creates a build-up that poses quite a challenge to tackle. Some of those entries are really important, and I'm not happy about putting them off.

						I finally made first contact. Close to a month ago when I first conceived of my plan to try to throw p06 a surprise birthday party, I always knew that there would be some obstacles to overcome, but I never imagined that getting in touch with her parents would be such torture. As I devised a course of action, my first thought was to use my still undeleted Facebook account to message p06's parents. (It also occurred to me that I continue finding uses for my Facebook account; maybe I should reevaluate deleting it.) Conveniently, p06 had a number of family members listed on her account, so it was rather trivial to find her parents and send them a message. (<span class="person p013">Her mom</span> was the only one I expected to reply since it turned out that her dad's account was maintained by her mom.) After waiting a reasonable amount of time, I decided that p06's mom didn't check her Facebook account often enough to to be reliably contacted that way, so I tried a few other family members from p06's list. Again, it seemed that they too couldn't be expected to see my message in time. Far from hopeless, I scoured the Internet searching for alternative means of contact; afterall, the Internet knows everything. The most success came from the Whitepages: I found some home phone numbers and <span class="elaborate">an address that was plainly wrong</span>.<aside data-heading="Explanation" data-revisit="expand">It didn't go anywhere on my bus route.</aside> It didn't take long to find out that the phone numbers were just as useless as the address. I figured the best thing to do was to go through the rest of the family members on p06's Facebook account. Sadly, it seems that the majority of p06's family is social invalids. Going back to the Whitepages, I searched for information on the rest of her family members. I got a few results, but none of them panned out either. At this point, I was starting to get desperate: I was running out of things to try, and p06's birthday was a little over a week away. I was beginning to consider the possibility of taking the surprise away and directly confronting p06. I wasn't about to give up yet, though. I thought about messaging basically all of p06's parent's friends on Facebook, but that seemed like a drastic step, and I wasn't sure what the turn-around time on that would be. Thinking back to the Whitepages, I remembered that, if you were a premium member, you could get access to things like cell phone numbers, but I had waived that opportunity since "premium" always means "pay money". However, desperate times call for desperate measures; I was going to look into it. As it would just so happen, there's an option for a one-time payment for one person's information. I chose p06's mom and reluctantly parted with $<span data-currency="USD">9.99</span>. With this newfound information, I began making my way through the 10 phone numbers listed. I tried something like 6 of the most promising ones and <em>none</em> of them were valid. Along with the phone numbers, though I recieved a bunch of other information including addresses. Although there were countless addresses, one stood out to me due to its position along my bus route. More than that, it stood out to me because it was within walking distance of my old house. I have a lot to say about this, but to stay on track with this story, I'll hide it in a separate section <span class="elaborate">here</span>;
						<aside data-heading="Rant">Let's take a moment to really drive home what I just said: <em>p06 lives within walking distance of my old house.</em> That means that, <strong>for the whole time that I knew her</strong>, one of my closest friends has only been separated from me by maybe a 10-minute walk. <strong>For the whole time that I knew p06</strong>, instead of quietly sitting alone in my house (more or less), I could have been getting to know a person who I never felt I got to spend enough time with; instead of playing a videogame with an extra controller in order to trick it into showing me what the two-player functionality was like, there could have actually been two players; instead of jogging down the driveway and around the well house to get exercise, I could have jogged down to p06's house. Having this information could have completely changed how I spent my time outside of school. p06's desire to keep me from knowing which bus stop she got off at sabotaged my chances of getting to know her outside of school. If that's not bad enough, she <em>knew</em> that I lived that close: she knew what bus stop I got on at, so she knew that there was a distinct possibility that I could walk to her house, and yet she <em>still</em> kept it to herself (<span class="h2">or maybe that's why she didn't say anything</span>). Worse yet, mainly due to my stellar fund-raising efforts, <strong>I have literally walked by her house countless times and even gone so far as to <em>KNOCK ON THE DOOR</em></strong>! Although my main memory of her house is that no one ever answered, I've been around it so often that I could recognize all of her neighbors; I could almost map out her part of the neighborhood by memory; I could tell her anecdotes about the people surrounding her and how my family almost moved into the house <strong><em>right across the street</em></strong>! I remember one time when I told p06 how she should show more initiative with her fund raisers and venture out into her neighborhood; I suppose it's good that she didn't because it would have taken away from my business. p06 could have lived anywhere else and, although fairly close, it would still take some effort to visit her. But no: she lived so close to me that, had she lived a few more houses down the street, <strong>she would have used the same bus stop as me</strong>! p015 thought he was jealous when he found out that p06 rode my bus; just think of how he'd feel knowing that p06 could have made regular visits to my house. I had always gotten the impression that p06 used one of the earlier bus stops before my stop: after all, no one can live that close to someone without them knowing about it, right? WRONG! I've been running laps in front of her house for years without ever knowing it. For all of the band camps, all of the concerts, all of summer school, we've gone to and from basically the same places. Remember when I graduated and I was lamenting the separation from my friends? That could have been solved in short order. Remember when I didn't want to take a special trip to p06's house because I didn't want my dad to make something of it? Throw that out the window: being able to walk there changes everything. <span class="h4">I really think that I would have started making frequent visits to p06's house if I had known that she lived so close to me</span>; she's a nice person, and I really liked being around her... But now I don't live near her. Now I can't take a stroll down the street and say "hi" to a good friend; now I can't find relief from my isolation; now I can't learn what's going on in p06's life beyond our brief encounters. <span class="e23">My efforts to circumvent her aversion to telling me where she lived came 6 months too late.</span></aside>
						I strongly encourage reading it, especially if you're p06. Aside from my other thoughts on the nearness of her house, though, I saw it as an opportunity to close the separation between me and p06's parents. As luck would have it, my parents wanted to do some stuff at the old house yesterday. (As luck would also have it, the itch of my chigger bites had pretty much dissapated by that time, so I was more mobile.) In anticipation of the trip (and during the trip), I wrote a letter for p06's parents and put it in a letter, so I could put it in their mailbox. When I had the opportunity at the other house, I asked to go down to the mailbox (which is pretty far away) with the ploy of making measurements for a mailbox indicator. Although I did make measurements of the mailbox in order to keep myself honest, I also made a quick detour to p06's house to deliver my letter. Today, I got a call from p06's mom. <span class="e66">Victory!</span>
					</section>

						p06's mom calling me was the high point of my day, but there have been complications since then. (Doesn't the universe know that I don't like rollercoaster rides?) Starting with the conversation, p06's mom seemed totally on board with the idea and, thankfully, wasn't at all concerned with the fact that a guy was trying to do something nice for her single daughter. <span class="person p013">She</span> wondered what sort of things I had in mind (not much) and offered some ideas of her own (also not much). In the end, we basically decided to think things over, contact some people, and talk tomorrow. Later in the day, I got a text from <span class="person p0">one of p06's friends</span> (I can take a guess at who it is, but they didn't say) who discouraged me from putting together a party since they didn't think p06 would want one.

Forget decorations; forget a cake; forget other people; I don't want to lose my one chance to see a person I haven't seen in nearly 2 years. She would surely still be happily surprised even if I showed up on my own. I know I've avoided visiting my friends one-on-one because of what my dad might think and say, but I've invested way too much time and energy into this. I might be able to come up with some way of avoiding the full force of his lectures, but if I can't, so be it: I'm not letting this opportunity slip through my fingers. I'm not sure what the next conversation with p06's mom will bring, but I do know one thing: it will bring me to p06.

						Life is so unfair: <span class="e33">I spent nearly a month trying to put something together for p06, and it was all for nothing.</span> Particularly since my last entry, I've been suspecting that things wouldn't work out as great as I had imagined, but as I said, I was going to at least visit p06 and give her something on her birthday (today). But no: apparently even that was asking too much. After not getting a second phone call on Friday, I tried to keep up with things with a painfully slow-moving conversation via text. It wasn't until yesterday that it was finally decided that no one was really going to show up, and I expressed my desire to show up anyway. p06's mom seemed more than willing to go ahead with that, but there were a few plans that we had to make sure that we didn't conflict with; she said she'd find out exactly when things were happening today. This morning, p06's mom said that her sister was going to surprise p06 with a shopping trip, so I had to wait until they got back before I could visit. Time went by; I made sure I hadn't been forgotten about; I started getting worried that I wouldn't have much time to visit. I knew that p06 was going to have a special dinner with her family followed by church, so I knew that my visit would have to end at about 6:00, and it was getting late. At around 4:00, I got a text from p06's mom saying that p06 had ended up going to <span class="person p016">one of her friends</span>' house. I knew that p06 wouldn't be leaving her friend's house any time soon; I had lost my chance to see p06 on her birthday.

						I think it's safe to assume that p06's mom isn't going to inform me of another opportunity to see p06. If she was ever going to tell me anything, it would have been last weekend or at least Wednesday, but now another weekend is coming up, and I've still heard nothing. I was skeptical as I entered into the weekend before, but now it's just ridiculous to hold out hope. Speaking of the weekend, though, I recieved a text from p06 on Sunday responding to the last thing I said on her birthday. I told her how she was a little late, and after apologizing, she asked to call me. As I'm sure you're familiar with by now, I had my reservations about speaking to her out loud on the phone with my parents around. To compound the issue, my parents had been hovering around my room, so my chances of hiding away and holding a phone call without them noticing were quite slim. Given the bleak outlook for me being able to see p06 any time soon, I really wanted to at least talk to her, but I didn't know how I was going to make it work. <mark data-revisit="remark as e22?">To my great disappointment, I had to decline p06's offer.</mark> ... Just kidding: my desire to talk to her won out by a slim margin. Considering how this is the main thing I wanted to mention, I ordinarily would have started this entry out with something like, "I got to talk to p06 on Sunday," but then I wouldn't have been able to lead you to believe that I decided to take the infuriatingly reclusive course of action. I was really close to it, though; I just couldn't stand the idea of turning down a phone call from p06 yet again when I had been building up my hopes of so much more for so long before. <mark class="e65">I didn't regret it.</mark>

						Yesterday was p05's birthday. Before your imagination starts running wild, no: my day didn't involve p05 at all. As a matter of fact, I would have typed this yesterday if I hadn't forgotten that I wanted to. The main point I want to make here is that I haven't forgotten about p05 (you know, except for yesterday). It's been over four years since we broke up, but I still think of her regularly, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Both good and bad, p05 has left a lasting impact on my life. The thing I wish I could change most, though, is that we reestablished our friendship. However, regardless of anything that transpired between us, I harbor no anger towards her. p05 still means a lot to me, and I wish her all the best.

						Remember how I keep saying I need to change how I do things with this journal? That time has come. Since the end of summer, I've been especially wanting get this journal on track, so I can at least not feel like I'm falling even further behind. I think the thing to do is to note the most important things of each day and then only write about them in monthly updates. As I'm sure even you can notice, the more recent something is, the more I feel compelled to elaborate on it. By putting things off a while, I'm giving myself time to stop caring about whatever thing I thought was critical to describing myself. Also, I'm going to make sure that I only go up to something like a week prior, so I don't start getting up to current events and sabotage my efforts. In order to prevent myself from sounding too boring and biographical, I'm still going to try to add entries at the time of the event when something especially important happens, but I think I'm going to have to put them after the recollection of the relavant month or do some sort of fancy integration because there will undoubtedly be things that I want to reference which you won't know about until I've made such a recollection.

					<section>
						Keeping with my resolution to get this back on track, I'm going to go over the things that have happened to me since I've started keeping a daily log of my activities. Despite what I've just told you, I'm going to bring things all the way up to today (as opposed to stopping a week before I get to today) since I want to start with a clean slate. This wouldn't have been a problem if I had gotten to this right after the end of summer when my life was lame, but now I'm really going to have to work to make sure I don't get carried away with myself. I think some of it is fairly worth mentioning, though, so I don't feel too bad about it. (But then again, maybe I wouldn't feel the same way in a week or so.)

								I dug up some old things I wrote; in particular, my essay that I read at the Veterans Day assembly in 10<sup>th</sup> grade and an essay I wrote about the Jump Rope for Heart contest I won in elementary school. I was most intrigued by the second item since it was typed while I was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade (and therefore when the memory was much more recent), and although many details are similar or believable (if I don't remember), there are a few critical details which are completely different: <a href="/journal/entries/first#jumpRopeForHeartStory">I stated earlier</a> how the jump roping contest came down to me and my primary rival, p9. People started cheering my name (instead of his); I felt bad for him (but still enjoyed it); and I eventually came out on top. Well, according to <span data-revisit="add a link">Jumping to Victory</span>, p9 got out unusually early; I eventually came out on top over <span class="p0">some random person</span>; and <em>some time afterwards</em> people started cheering my name. That's completely different! Moreover, that essay was written no more than a year and a half before I wrote the completely different version in this journal. And when I discuss my current version of events, it's not like I'm trying to recollect some faint memory that I have a general feeling about; I'm <em>certain</em> that things happened the way I remember them. It especially stuck with me how everyone was cheering my name instead of p9's; that's not something people forget. There isn't the least bit of doubt in my mind that my recollection of those events is correct, but at the same time, how am I supposed to argue with myself? I've tried considering that I may have subconsciously condensed the most interesting Jump Rope for Heart stories from multiple years into one super awesome year, but I keep coming back to my vivid recollection of people cheering for me and me feeling bad for p9: p9 and I were the last ones standing basically every year, so that could have been any time, but I have a hard time believing that people would have cheered for me on two different years. Not only do I consider it generally unlikely, but also, wouldn't <em>that</em> be something I'd remember? <span class="afterthought elaborate obvious" data-date="2018/10/5">Future.</span><aside class="afterthought" data-heading="Reconsideration" data-date="2018/10/5">The more I think about it, the more I think people may have actually cheered for me on two separate years, and during the second time, I was thinking how everyone must have been pretty desperate to cheer.

On a different note (mainly because I'm worried that I won't mention it earlier), it seems that my dad has developed a fairly close relationship with our neighbor's adult daughters (who are a little older than me).

I took the congratulations but not the lemonade since I was in a hurry and I don't like lemonade anyway. Later in the day in one of my classes, I noticed that the class was going to be centered around basically exactly what it would take to carry out an experiment I had been wanting to do (putting a certain unit of DNA into a bacterium which would cause it to make a certain enzyme that's useful in copying a sample of DNA).

Don't get me wrong, I'm more than capable of providing an exceptionally detailed description of exactly what makes her so beautiful and what sort of feelings that instills in me, but I generally consider myself to project some degree of professionallity and control which helps people take me seriously and trust me, and I'd like to keep those impressions at least somewhat maintained. Besides, delving into that too deeply would chip away at the mental barriers I've established to prevent myself from getting too carried away (not that typing this has done me any favors).</aside> Ordinarily, I wouldn't have mentioned it, but given that most people are more or less settled in by the second class, I couldn't help but notice certain irregularities: For one thing, she doesn't seem to have any friends in the class. More than that, there just so happens to be a seat open right next to her (which is one of very few total open seats). Even more than that, while everyone else was dead to the world looking at their phones, she was casually looking around the room waiting for class to start. As if that's not enough, when she introduced herself during the first class, she seemed rather soft-spoken (which I often consider cute) and I'm pretty sure she was majoring in something at least mildly similar to biology (which is always a plus). In other circumstances, I'd be careful to make sure that I'm not giving preferential treatment to anyone, but everything is making it so easy; she's just begging me to go over there. Just to be clear, I don't have a crush on her, that's only happened to me once and that will be the only time if I can help it; however, if that girl is feeling lonely in class, I strongly suspect that she's going to find herself with a new friend very soon.

						Today was the first meeting of the Biology Club<note-><div><div>I can't make up my mind whether I should capitalize "biology club" since it's such a generic name, but at the same time, it's kind-of being used as a proper noun.</div></div></note->. Considering how my whole day has centered around the Biology Club and I still have a respectable amount of homework due tomorrow, I don't have much time to dwell on this (there's a shocker), but I think you can agree that this is an event that deserves some mention. Since I'm not likely to say it before this, the reason the meeting was today is because there's a time slot between 12:00 and 1:30 when the university doesn't plan any classes. Naturally, I'd like to make the first meeting be one that everyone can attend, so I planned it on a Wednesday at 12:00 when I'd be prepared. Naturally again, however, other people have the same idea which can force people to pick which club they want to go to. I thought I had lucked out and gotten a time that didn't conflict with the clubs that people interested in a biology club might also be interested in; however, as I noticed earlier today, the Student Medical Society planned their [first?] meeting in the same time slot as mine. I instantly knew that I lost a large fraction of my potential members. Hopefully, I'll be able to make it so that future meetings don't conflict with that or any other relavant clubs; then maybe I'll be able to regain some of that fraction.
					</section>
					<section>
						The meeting itself went pretty well. I was worried that my subconscious nerves would make it difficult for me to get through the meeting, but aside from a little stiffness and forgetting a few of the things I wanted to say, things seemed to go pretty smoothly. It was strange walking into the room because you could have sworn that everyone was waiting around for a class to start and I was the teacher. I would have prefered to have arrived early, but I misjudged how long it would take me to get my laundry going, so I ended up sliding in at the last minute. Consistent with the environment of a classroom, there were a lot of blank stares, but I got a few reactions out of some people, and I'd like to assume that the other people were having a good time on the inside (or at least as much of a good time as you can have at an informational meeting). Something I found surprising was that Dr. Taylor wasn't there: I thought for sure he'd be there especially since it was the first meeting and there are no classes going on at the time. <span class="h2">I guess he figured I'd do great no matter what, so he wouldn't show up and cramp my style.</span> Another person who wasn't there was a member of the old biology club who's basically the only person who still participates in the SEMO Biology Club Facebook group and, moreover, still goes to SEMO. As it turns out, she's president of the Student Medical Society.
					</section>
					<section>
						Something that didn't go quite as planned was getting everyone to fill out a survey to help me figure out how to plan things; namely, there was no survey for them to fill out. Although I had finished the survey last night, I didn't send it to Dr. Taylor until after my early classes this morning since I was worried that I had overlooked something important in my effort to hurry to get it finished; I plainly didn't give him enough time to get them printed up. To make up for it, I got out a piece of paper for people to pass around and write their emails on. When I got it back, I should have asked if everyone got it, but I'm pretty sure they did.<note-><div><div>I had done a quick count of the people present, and it was actually less than the number of emails I got.</div></div></note-> There were 22 emails, over &frac23; of which were from girls (which parallels the ratio in the majority of my classes).<span class="elaborate obvious" data-revisit="date = 10/2/2018">Future</span><aside data-heading="Correction">I found out later that at least one girl was there and "forgot" to put their email.</aside> As it turns out, there actually were a lot of important things I had overlooked in my survey, so I suppose people not getting the first version worked out for the best. I emailed everyone with the revised survey.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I was finished with my primary presentation, I gave people the opportunity to leave but invited them to stay to watch an awesome biology-related music video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k99bMtg4zRk">A Capella Science's CRISPR Cas9</a>). Some losers left but most people stayed, and I think they approved of my selection. I also ended up showing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWU0bfo-bSY">squirrel obstacle course</a>. I didn't end up showing the Facebook group, but they can figure that out. In the end, three people stayed behind to discuss all things biology club. (Technically, 5 people stayed behind, but two of them left the room before the music video and then wandered around outside the room until I came out, which begs the question, "Why did they leave in the first place?") Maybe I can get them to help me with some stuff because doing everything myself is killing me: I'm not quite to a Boston University level of sleep yet, but I'm well on my way; I need to spread out some responsibility. After we talked awhile, I went to the first meeting (this year) of the robotics club. They seemed happy to have a biology major join them, and they eventually got something to roll around on the ground.

						Today I confronted the girl who has been acting like she knows me. As I sat in the dining hall minding my own business, who should come by but that mystery girl. Once again, she shyly smiled at me and waved, and I was reminded of how I had no idea who she was. As she walked away, I was thinking how I couldn't let this keep going on. I tossed it around in my mind for a while, but eventually, I decided that I was going to go sit with her and her friends, so I could actually get to know her. Luckily, they were sitting nearby, so I wouldn't feel too uncomfortable leaving some of my stuff behind which would be too bulky to take with me. I took my plate and drink, pretended like I had somewhere to go in the opposite direction, looped around, and headed for her table. As I approached, the girl saw me and gave me that shy smile routine again, undoubtedly under the impression that I was just passing by. Much to her and her friends' surprise, I sat right next to her and said something along the lines of, "Hello... Who are you?" It turns out that her name is p017.
					</section>
					<section>
						Over the course of my time at the table, I had a chance to uncover some information about p017. Foremost of the things I wanted to know was whether we actually knew each other before. In direct contrast to "I think [we know each other]", she admitted that we really don't know each other at all. Apparently, she just saw me and wanted to say "hi" or some other lame excuse like that, and we didn't have any other connection before that. I asked her whether she pretended like she knew people often, and she said that this was her first time. Later on, she was telling me how she was generally bored, so I told her how that must inspire her to start staring at people.<note-><div><div>She never actually stared at me much, though (that I noticed).</div></div></note-> At one point, she asked me whether I had a SnapChat account, and after being disappointed, she took a short video of me to share with her friends, presumably on SnapChat. Other things I learned about p017 include: she's a freshman; she lives on the 9<sup>th</sup> floor of Towers South; she's majoring in computer science; and she thinks I look like Ron Weasley (which she somehow tried to relate to how she told me that she thinks we know each other). I wanted to ask what country she was from, but I didn't want to presume she was from another country, especially since she didn't really have an accent. (She's totally from another country, though.) By the way, she was plainly embarrassed throughout all of this.
					</section>
					<section>
						After a fairly short period of time, p017 and her friends finished eating and decided to leave. As they left, I got a phone call from p11. When I answered, he told me how he heard that I was hanging out with a bunch of girls. (By the way, I saw him leave the dining hall before I went to sit with p017 and her friends.) After making some jokes, he told me to meet him in the Towers South lobby when I was finished eating. Eventually, I finished eating and proceeded to the lobby. When I arrived, I was surprised to find not only p11 and some random people but also p017 and her friends. Once she saw me, p017 rhetorically asked whether I was following her now. Apparently, p11 knows p017 and her friends, and it was because he was with one of her other friends that he saw the video of me on SnapChat and knew that I was "hanging out with a bunch of girls." When will I stop being surprised that p11 knows everyone? Anyway, p11 and I talked some while everyone else was playing pool and listening to the music one of them was playing through a speaker. It seemed like it would be fun to stay, but I value sleep and finishing homework, so soon enough, I had to make my departure. Too bad I haven't accomplished much in terms of getting sleep and finishing homework.

						In case you're interested, another event of interest today was that, after nearly two weeks of waiting, I finally got the bioluminescent algae from the professor who had it. Hopefully, I can get it to glow for the Biology Club meeting tomorrow (because it's sure not doing anything now). Another thing that happened is someone throwing up in the hallway. Unlike some people, they actually made an effort to clean it up, and they were grateful when I found a janitor for them. If you prefer to end with something less gross, I can tell you that there was a new puzzle today which I made decent progress on. Also, it's p018' birthday today, but I didn't see her to tell her "happy birthday."

					<section>
						p017 most definitely has a crush on me. As I've said, I've been pretty suspicious of p017 for a while now, but she finally passed the threshold I set for what it takes for me to be sure. While I was getting my food at lunch today, I happened to encounter p017 and her two main friends. As usual, I was enthusiastically greeted, and having just arrived at the dining hall, they proceeded to gather food and find a place to sit. Since I hadn't sat down yet, and I secretly like sitting with enthusiastic people, I made a few extra laps around the dining hall in an effort to stall while they settled in. Once the time seemed right, I took a trip right past their table, and wouldn't you know it; they invited me to sit with them. After acting like I wasn't sure whether I'd take them up on their offer, I obliged. It was during this meal that I became sure of p017's thoughts about me.
					</section>
					<section>
						Without wasting much time, p017 and her friends began subjecting me to a barrage of questions. One of the earlier questions especially caught my attention, though: "Do you have a girlfriend?" Care to guess who asked that one? I said how I found it interesting that she (p017) would ask that question, to which her friends laughed and p017 told me, "Just answer the question!" I considered not saying anything, but I wanted to see what her response would be, so I informed her of my availablity. Conveniently, p017 then began lamenting her lack of a boyfriend. Now, I may be able to come up with some way that a person might randomly start acting like they know someone; I may be able to dismiss a display of fairly intense interest; I might even be able to imagine that a person is poking me and wiggling their eyebrows as a joke; but when you put all of that together along with a blatantly obvious attempt to establish that we're both single, there's just no getting around the fact that p017 is crushing on me big-time. Moreover, she surely knows that I know what she's thinking, but she really doesn't seem to care at all. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around how someone can be that bold about their feelings about another person when I've never seen anything like that before. I've had a number of girls act extra-interested in me, but I generally considered it just that: acting. I've also had girls who were actually interested in me but who tried to be at least a little subtle. (The ones I know of are p05 and Kim.) However, blatant legitimate flirting like that is only something I've ever seen occasionally on TV (assuming p014 never actually had a crush on me). I pretty much figured that such behavior didn't really exist or at least that my personality didn't attract the people who would do that. It seems that I was mistaken. It especially gets me how, not only did p017 ask whether I had a girlfriend and tell me that she didn't have a boyfriend, but she also went out of her way to seem especially pouty when addressing her relationship status, and she made sure that there could be no doubt about the link between my answer and her statement by making sure that she immediately lead into her predicament; she wanted to make it <em>extremely</em> clear what she was hoping for. I didn't expect her to be so direct (without actually being direct); it's a rather strange approach. Another thing I find strange is how she can possibly have a crush on me when we know essentially nothing about each other: Maybe we're getting to know each other a little <em>now</em>, but that doesn't explain the past, and we've still had very few interactions beyond just seeing each other in passing. p017 having a crush on me with so little information to go on makes about as much sense as someone picking someone else out at random, eating brunch with them on two separate occasions, and then suddenly becoming so caught up in the person that they try to plan the time and place of their meals in order to optimize their chances of an encounter. <span class="t0">Oh wait...</span>
					</section>
					<section>
						At this point, you may be wondering how I feel about p017. Although I don't share the intensity of her desire to be with me, I can't help but be drawn to someone who's so interested in me. Besides that, she's plenty friendly (of course), and she can keep a conversation going, so that's nice. Beyond that, I know very little about her: I have very little information on her interests; my primary knowledge of her interactions with people is of what she does when she really wants to go out with someone; I don't know what she wants to do with her life; I don't know how she handles disagreements; I don't know what her family life is like; I don't really know much of anything. I sure know that she doesn't have a boyfriend, though. As I've surely said many times before, I don't want to make a commitment to anyone without having a high degree of certainty that the relationship has the potential to last indefinitely; with so little information about her, it's hard for me to say whether p017 qualifies. Perhaps more importantly is the fact that she's from another country: Once one of us leaves this university (I don't even know who would be first since I don't know whether she's a regular or exchange student), there will be very little opportunity for contact, and that's just setting things up for disaster. I suppose there's the possibility that she has some kind of frequent association with this country, but I wouldn't count on that, and I know I won't be going to Nepal any time soon. Regardless of whether p017 turned out to be someone I'd like to pursue a relationship with, I'm skeptical of the chances of things working out.
					</section>
					<section>
						So the question now is, "What am I going to do about this?" As long as I'm careful about not leading p017 on, I don't really feel the need to do anything: It's not like I'm being stalked; I don't have a girlfriend to get jealous; and who doesn't like an admirer? I don't see a problem here. However, I really do need to be careful about not leading p017 on. She probably has some idea that I'm not ready to dive into a relationship (given the circumstances) since she has made her intentions abundantly clear, and I haven't responded to them, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult for her to forget about that if I gave her a reason to. Another thing to worry about is p017 directly asking me out. Although I doubt it would be the end of the world, I don't want to have to get in to all of this, and chances are, she wouldn't find my points very convincing anyway. There's always the possibility that such a confrontation is inevitable, but I think I can decrease the likelihood of it happening if I never address her crush directly, even in joking. A borderline example happened at lunch today: While p017 was trying to leave because she had something to do, <span class="person p0" data-revisit="Maddie Brown">one of her friends</span> was still trying to finish eating (or maybe it was drinking). After insistantly being prompted to leave, I told her that she should let p017 leave, so we could hang out and make her jealous.<note-><div><div>Her friend even responded with, "True."</div></div></note-> To that, p017 asked why I was trying to make her jealous and yet again moved her eyebrows up and down at me. I never explicitly mentioned p017's crush on me, but making veiled references to it like that could prove problematic if I do it too often. Also, there's the chance that p017 interpreted what I said as a suggestion of interest in her. I need to watch myself.

					<section class="t5">
						I'm such a sneak. A week ago today, I was going to dinner when I saw p017's friends in the study lounge again. We waved at each other, and since they're never parted from each other, I figured that p017 must have been temporarily occupied elsewhere. I ate dinner, and when I came back by, only a few people I didn't recognize were left in the study lounge, but p017's friends' stuff (and surely hers) was still there, so they must have been planning on coming back. As I headed back to my room, a solution to a problem began forming in my mind: Although I didn't want to reinforce p017's crush, the idea of spending a larger amount of time with her wasn't especially unappealing. Since we don't cross paths too often, the only feasible way of making that a reality would be establishing a means of contact to serve as a point of coordination, but any direct request or obvious display of interest would certainly put me in dangerous waters. If only there were some way of exchanging phone numbers without arousing suspicion... After thoroughly debating the plan in my mind, I began to put it into action: I took a fourth of a notecard and began writing my phone number on it. To cover my tracks, I made sure to write some of the numbers a little differently and format the phone number in a way that I wouldn't normally. I took a quick trip to the study lounge and found it the same as I had seen before. In a calm yet efficient manner, I placed the piece of notecard with my phone number on it in a noticeable location near what I assumed to be p017's stuff and quickly made my exit. Upon examination of the hallway for recognizable witnesses, my successful escape was confirmed. About an hour after returning to my room, I received a strange phone call from a Florida phone number: Interestingly, they immediately asked me who I was; however, being the one who received the phone call, I felt entitled to figuring out who they were first. We went back and fourth for a while, and eventually, I gave in and told them who I was. For some reason, there was a large amount of laughing on the other line. With that, the stranger nearly hung up on me, but I insisted on finding out who they were. It was p017; can you believe that? When I asked how she managed to get my number, she told me some crazy story about finding it laying on a table. After that, she apologized for disturbing me and hung up. ... Victory!
					</section>
					<section>
						Admittedly, I've been thinking a lot about my recent determination of p017's feelings towards me. I've been waiting for the intensity of the feelings to return before I write about it, but especially since the later part of last school year, I've been really wanting a girlfriend. Without spoiling all of what I might say in a future entry, I'll tell you that, contrary to the usual reasons people want girlfriends, my motivation stems from my desire for the type of close companionship that can most easily (and most acceptably) be derived from a romantic relationship. Although my initial reaction was one of objective intrigue, my desire for a girlfriend has quickly morphed it into something to be given serious consideration. It would be <strong><em>so</em></strong> easy for me to give in to p017; it's an exceptionally tempting situation. However, that being said, I can't ignore the challenges I've identified with such a relationship. It's very likely that our contact with each other will end with our time in college, and I don't even know whether our personalities and interests are compatible with each other. I realize that many if not most people wouldn't consider those to be valid reasons, but besides that fact that I just wouldn't feel right getting into a relationship with no future, there's also the point that, if I'm already involved in a relationship, I'll be preventing myself from getting closer to people who there may be true potential with. Additionally, I've been trying to think of how to phrase my rebuttal to the not-knowing-her-well-enough part, and I think I finally have it:
					</section>
					<ul class="t0">
						<li>
							It's not fair to the other person if I always keep some distance between us.
						</li>
						<li>
							I'll always be holding back until I know there's a negligible chance of them abandoning me.
						</li>
						<li>
							I can't be sure they won't abandon me until they know all the important things about me.
						</li>
						<li>
							I need to trust a person a whole lot before I'm comfortable revealing some things.
						</li>
						<li>
							My trust is earned over a long period of time after getting to know a person very well.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						As such, despite my desire to have a girlfriend and p017's obvious willingness to fill that position, I'm worried that indulging her (and myself) would lead me down a path that does more harm than good.
					</section>
					<section>
						In other news, p11 drove me home for Thanksgiving break. Although I could talk about a number of things such as how I didn't realize I needed to tell him I was ready to leave (unlike previous times) which allowed me to have a rather relaxed period of time after finishing packing, the thing I'm going to focus on is a conversation during the trip involving p017. For a significant part of the car ride, I didn't bring p017 up because I didn't want to seem overly anxious, but eventually I mentioned the "interesting phone call" I received. I promptly followed it up with an inquiry of his knowledge of the event (as a gentle accusation). Naturally, he knew nothing about it, but I tried to seem at least a little suspicious since <span class="elaborate">he would be the prime suspect</span><aside><ul><li>He knows my phone number.</li><li>He knows p017.</li><li>He likes messing with me at every possible opportunity.</li><li>He thinks I should get a girlfriend.</li></ul></aside> if I didn't stage the whole thing. Although I couldn't be certain, I got this strange impression that p11 suspected me of something: I'm not sure if he was calculating the odds of me sneaking my phone number to p017 like that or if he was contemplating my true feelings of the event or what, but it seemed to me that his mind was hard at work. Not too long later, I worked in how p017 has a massive crush on me. Much to my surprise, rather than blindly accepting it and proceeding to tease me about it, he asked me how I could be sure. Even though he seemed relatively satisfied with my reasoning for why I know p017 has a crush on me, his satisfaction quickly plummeted when it came to explaining why I'm not going out with her. When the conversation had mostly died down, p11 told me how he knew "that p017 stuff" had been on my mind for a while. Before I had a chance to pretend like he was being ridiculous, he also added how he didn't want to hear a number of uncannily accurate flimsy deflections that I typically use. That didn't stop me from using a different one, though. I'd like to state for the record, though, that my flimsy deflections aren't all that flimsy, especially when accompanied by reinforcing facial expressions and tone of voice. It seems, however, that I need to come up with an even better cover when talking p11 now. I remember back in the good old days when, any time p11 asked me something I didn't want to answer, I could just stare at him, act like he was being ridiculous, and he would move on; now I stare at him, act like he's being ridiculous, and he calls my bluff. Not cool, p11. Not cool.

						Last night, I had a dream about p09. In between a bunch of other random science-related stuff, we had friendly conversation and worked together on a variety of things. At one point, p09 semi-abruptly walked out of a building I was in, and I followed her. When I caught up with her, she looked torn, and she told me how she had found the link to this journal and read it (implying that she read about my addiction even though, in the real world, there's not much to read about at this point in time). I was extremely worried about what would happen next, but I tried to not freak out, and I let her have her space as I went back to doing whatever I was doing (at that time, I think it was organizing an event). Later on, I saw p09 come back to do her share of some of the work, but I couldn't tell what she thought of me since she was busy and kind-of far away. Eventually, however, p09 came over to me and, although seemingly still trying to process what she had found out, she told me how she hadn't left me. Since I hadn't yet recovered from my panic attack, I didn't say much, but I thought how, after I calmed down some, I'd very much like to give her a hug... I just hope the real world isn't too different.

						This is the last full day before I go back to college. Yesterday, a massive snow storm came through putting down 8 or so inches of snow. As a result, my dad and I spent essentially the whole day shoveling snow. Although it's nice to have help with a large amount of manual labor, I'd rather do the whole thing myself than work with my dad. Consistant with every single other time I've ever worked with my dad, shoveling the driveway was misery. Before we even went outside, I had to battle over what to wear: My parents refuse to believe that I'm capable of determining what I need to wear to stay warm, so I was forced to put on extra layers. <aside></aside>Apparently, I'm so incapable of intelligent thought that I can't be trusted to know something as basic as whether my body is at a comfortable temperature. From there, I was subjected to a nearly constant barrage of critisism from my dad. For a significant portion of the hours we were out there, I had to listen to him tell me how I was using the wrong shoveling technique; I was throwing the snow in the wrong place; I was shoveling too slowly; I was shoveling obnoxiously fast; I was going to get sick because I unzipped my coat and took the hood off because I was burning up. As has always been the case, there was nothing I could do which was good enough in the eyes of p1.

						I <strong><em>really</em></strong> want a girlfriend. Just to be clear, this isn't inspired by the common motivation of finding someone to have a shared addiction with; I just really want the kind of close companionship that's most easily obtained from a girlfriend. It's been about 5 years since I was with p05, and although I wasn't too eager to jump right into another relationship at the time, I'm more than ready now. With starts and stops over time, I've been feeling this way since the second semester of last year. Though subtle and mainly observed within my mind, I've noticed changes in my thoughts and behavior: I've become significantly more likely to evaluate the appearances of girls and possibly treat them a little differently than I would normally; very often when talking to a girl, I'm silently gauging their compatibility with me; I could swear that I've been exhibiting a greater propensity for sitting with and conversing with girls instead of guys (but then again, I've been wondering about that for a long time); I've become rather unconcerned if my actions are perceived as flirting; I'm often plotting ways to spend more time with girls... Although there's a decent chance that I'm not giving my restraint enough credit, there are many times when I feel like I'm just barely preventing myself from professing my undying love to whoever I may be with at the time, especially if they're pretty and more so if I know them kind-of well. Depending on who I'm with, I may be having a casual friendly conversation with a girl, but in my head I'm thinking, "Wow, she's pretty." "I never want to stop talking with her." "How can I get her to meet up with me some other time?" "Come on, give me your phone number!" I feel like I've developed a kind of moderate insanity. I know there are plenty of guys out there (and surely girls as well) who would read this and be amused by my response to the kind of life they've embraced long ago, but I've come to expect some degree of rationality from my life, and it's disconcerting to have that thrown into question. At the same time, though, I'm typically not thinking about how disconcerting it is because I'm so overwhelmed by my exceptionally intense desire to have a girlfriend. It could be that my perception of the strength of the feeling is altered by my lack of experience with it, but regardless, the feeling is strong enough to occasionally inspire me to give serious consideration to the likelihood that I'll suddenly ask someone out without sufficient reason. What makes it worse is that there are quite a few girls who would almost certainly go out with me if I asked, and there are quite a few more who would likely be receptive to the idea if I turned up the charm for a little while. I can't do it, though: It's my responsibility to myself to make sure that a romantic relationship has an above average chance of success before I enter into it so any potential pain can be reduced. However, my conviction in that belief is faltering: Is the risk of potential pain really that high? Would I really have such a hard time bouncing back from a bad relationship? Is it really that bad to get into a relationship without knowing an excessive amount about that person? It has become an increasingly prevalent thought that I should decrease the requirements for people to become my girlfriend, and even if it doesn't work out, at least being in a short-lived relationship could take the edge off. This is aided by my reasoning that, as paranoid as I may be after what happened with p05 and p03, it's still generally unlikely that such experiences will repeat themselves. As such, it's difficult for me to counter how badly I want a girlfriend. And I mean really, <em>really</em> want a girlfriend (as if you didn't understand that before). I just want a girlfriend so badly. I want someone's hand to hold; I want someone to cuddle up next to; I want someone I can tell anything to; I want someone I can flatter on a regular basis. I <em>really, really, <strong>really</strong></em> want a girlfriend <strong><em>SO</em></strong> badly. I want a girlfriend so badly.

						Once again, I find myself really wanting to talk about certain things but not having time to talk about it. Besides the fact that I think it's an important part of my life, writing in here is like my own little counseling session, and it gives me a place to relieve some of my desire to tell people things when I don't have anyone I can talk to. It's extremely frustrating to perpetually postpone talking about important life events in the interests of finishing homework or running some dumb errand. I'll have to come up with some other way addressing the most important things of my life because I'm sick of this.

						Aunt Violet died today. Although it's never a good thing when a person dies, we were never particularly close, and this isn't especially surprising, so I feel rather detached from the whole situation. Naturally, this doesn't bode well for the ongoing legal dispute, and I can only imagine how much yelling is going on right now. Regrettably, I wasn't able to contact my grandma before this, and with this new drama added to the mix, I don't know if and when I'll have another chance; I know I sure won't be visiting her with my parents. (There may be a chance at the funeral, but I would have to be extremely careful to ensure that it didn't seem like I was defying my parents.) Despite all of this, I find myself more concerned with the very real possibility that I won't be around to see p024 when she comes back for her stuff this weekend. It's hard for me to determine whether that's callous or whether it's just a natural response for someone who never developed a real connection with the person; I'd like to think that it's the second one, but it's not unlikely that people would think that I should have developed a connection by now. Regardless, I felt like this needed to be mentioned, and since it doesn't take nearly as long to type as the other stuff I've been wanting to include, here it is.

Although I've never heard of this person before, apparently p024 met a guy on <a href="https://tinder.com/?lang=en">Tinder</a> moderately recently (a decent amount of time before she left SEMO), and just today, they've made things official. These events have inspired me to think about a number of things.
					</section>
					<section>
						The most obvious thing for me to address is what I think of p024's new relationship. I only have a limited amount of information to work with, but overall, I'm not very concerned about it. When p024 first brought this guy up with me yesterday, it was in the context of her finding out that he might also be involved with someone else, so naturally, I had my reservations about him. To my great surprise, though, p024 found the whole situation laughable: She said how they had never said that they were exclusive, and she just wanted to get things cleared up. I told her about my differing views on what should happen in relationships, but I also told her how it didn't really matter as long as both of them were on the same page. Interestingly, p024 has no intention of marrying this guy (although she's open to marriage), but she'd like to have an exclusive relationship, so she can have some fun and learn something from the experience. As far as I can tell, the guy is sincere and shares p024's relationship views. In case you're wondering, I really am fine with her being with someone else. Don't get me wrong: I care about her very deeply, and although I'll likely mention it before now, I've told her that I love her on two separate occasions (something which I won't take back), but at the same time, I recognize our differences, and I've been reluctant to encourage the idea of going out with her. Because of this, I can say with the utmost sincerity that, as long as this guy makes her happy, I think they should be together.
					</section>
					<section data-revisit="expand">
						That being said, I don't really understand why p024 is interested in this guy. Considering Tinder's method of matching people up, she surely finds him attractive, but even the most superficial people know that they can't base a relationship solely on appearance. I suppose whatever other similarities they share could make up for -----------------

					<section data-revisit="expand">
						Something not as obvious for me to think about as a result of this (although significantly more pervasive) is the physical aspects of relationships, in particular, the most intimate of all physical acts.

						To spare myself from needing to fill in the gaps later, I'll tell you that I'm planning a surprise birthday party for p024. Soon after my let-down of a birthday, I began thinking of p024 (as I do regularly) and how she has been rather lonely since she returned home. Having birthdays already floating around in my head made it really easy to form the idea that it could be fun to throw p024 a surprise birthday party. Not only would it help cheer her up, but it would also give me a chance to see her. Besides that, it would give me a chance to redeem myself after my miserable failure of a birthday party for p06 as well as more or less satisfy my desire to do for someone else what I appreciated so much myself. The fact that p024's birthday is about two months away (May 9) reinforces the idea that I have enough time to pull this off, and the fact that I love her reinforces my motivation to make it a reality.

						I debated whether I should sacrifice even more sleep to write about something that's only mildly important, but I'd like to say something, and it just won't be the same if I mention it while reflecting on this time in my life. I'll try to keep it short, but who knows if that will actually happen.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although I could talk about a number of things today, the one I'm going to focus on is how I found out today that p019 has a boyfriend. Maybe it's just me, but I find it rather strange that p019 talks so much about one guy (me) if there's another guy who should be more important to her. I haven't had the opportunity to do so yet, but I plan on asking her in the very near future whether she actually does talk about her boyfriend a lot, and I just don't hear it because she's talking about me when I'm around. (Since I don't plan on making another entry for it, I'll include the future answer <span class="elaborate">here</span><aside data-heading="Answer" data-date="2019/3/25">Apparently, p019 does talk quite a bit about her boyfriend.</aside>.) If such was actually the case, it would make a little more sense, but it would still seem fairly strange. I know I've told you that I've had a number of girls act extra-interested in me, but I didn't necessarily believe that they really wanted to pursue a relationship with me. p019, however, (and pretty much p020 too) was bordering on a p017-level of interest in me except that she replaced the flirty looks with nearly nonstop talking. Unlike p017, though, I was never fully convinced that there was more to p019's interest in me than just her general quirky sociability (after all, it takes a <em>lot</em> for me to be fully convinced), but I had been getting pretty suspicious. I'm just glad that I found out now because I was just beginning to reinforce the idea that I may like to get a little extra close to her. If p1 were here, he would tell me that the fact that p019 has a boyfriend shouldn't be used as evidence that she doesn't want to be with me, and I suppose that's somewhat possible even among my friends, but even if that's true, I'm not about to be the person who steals away someone's girlfriend. I have to admit, though, that I'm kind-of disappointed: p019 has been really friendly to me, and as you know, I really, really, <em>really</em> want a girlfriend. It takes all the will-power I have to not go around flirting with every girl I know (and some I don't know). I want to be able to be that close to someone so badly, but it's my responsibility to myself and to others to maintain some degree of professionality with my interactions with people. Naturally, I don't mean that I can't ever loosen up around people, but I want people to view me as a dignified individual who goes about things carefully and thoughtfully; I don't want to be that guy who's obsessed with girls and will pull out all the stops to score a date. As long as I knew when to call it quits, I'm sure people wouldn't have a problem with me being that second person, but that's not who I want to be. Besides, I'm not quite sure if it's possible for me to flirt with someone without developing the corresponding feelings (which would be problematic for girls who are taken). I've always admired people who kept their composure regardless of the circumstances, so the idea of giving that up to more effectlively chase girls leaves me with a sickening feeling. I want a girlfriend so badly, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						But I'm getting off topic: It turns out that p019 has a boyfriend, so now I have to reevaluate what her intense interest in me means and rein in whatever feelings I had been starting to develop for her. I don't want to distance myself from her because she's fun to be around, and she would surely be hurt by it anyway, but I'll have to be a lot more careful about how exactly I'm interacting with her from now on. I'm curious now, though, about whether p020 has a boyfriend; she's similarly hyper around me, and obviously, not hearing about a boyfriend is no indication of whether she has one or not. However, p020 doesn't go nearly as much out of her way to interact with me, and I think she derives a significant portion of her energy from p019. Then there's also p018. And p024. And any number of other girls who seem to like me. This girl stuff is driving me crazy. I remember back in the good old days when I would see people struggling with girl problems, and I would get annoyed by how much they stressed out about it, and I'd think how they needed to reorder their priorities. It's worth noting that I could understand the same kind of behavior for general friend problems, but the drama surrounding girls just made me sick to my stomach. I'd like to think that I don't quite fall into the category of people I was previously sickened by, but I'd be lying to myself if I didn't say that I would surely seem to be such a person at first glance. I try to take solace in the fact that these struggles reside almost exclusively in my mind and are quite difficult to observe in the real world. Moreover, I'd generally consider my problems to be more reminiscent of the general friend problems as opposed to the stereotypical girl problems experienced by those who pull out all the stops to score a date (and are upset if they fail), but it's not hard for me to see how that could be overlooked. For possibly a week or so now, I've been wanting to write some things about how I feel about p024 before I gave her the opportunity to read the partly unfinished, unlinked entries I've been trying to keep up with, and that might solve one girl problem, but the resolution isn't assured, and there's plenty more where that came from, anyway.
					</section>
					<section>
						Regardless of everything else going on, there's one problem I might be able to do something about: sleep. I could go on and on about this stuff all day long, but I have other stuff to do, the most pressing of which is sleep. I've been getting absolutely terrible sleep, and I have little hope that that will change any time soon, but I can at least get a slightly above average amount of sleep tonight (since the chance of a decent night's sleep is long gone). As you surely expected, I didn't do a very good job of getting through this quickly, and there's an endless list of more things I'd like to say, but I did get some of my feelings out, so it's not a total loss. For now, though, it's time to take one of those rare trips into my bed (after taking forever getting ready to do so).

						I really don't have time for this, but I want to at least mention it before it's too long ago: On Friday, I was invited to a frat party. You shold know by now that I'm generally not one to partake in such events, but <span class="person p0">the person inviting me</span> wasn't too crazy, I've been kind-of curious about what they were like, and I'm all for excuses to spend time with people. However, it turned out that they weren't even planning on leaving until 10:00 pm, and besides the fact that I've been chronically sleep-deprived and I'd be a kill-joy regardless, my nose had developed a tendency to constantly stream snot. I don't like turning down invitations, but it didn't seem like a good idea to go. While I was expressing my reservations, they even offered another chance to spend time with them at the movies; however, they were suggesting a horror movie, and as I told them, I don't especially like horror movies <span class="elaborate obvious">explanation</span>.
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">As I've likely said before regarding rollercoasters, I don't have a "fun" scared; there's just scared, not scared, and varying degrees in between. Although many people enjoy horror movies, I get legitimately scared watching them, so I don't find them very enjoyable.</aside>
						That was actually the second time in two days that I had to turn down an invitation to spend time with someone: After the Biology Club meeting on Thursday (that I had the vice president, p019, run so they could get the experience), p019 and p020 announced their plans to go to a place called Yummy Buffet, and invited everyone to come. It didn't seem like anyone was going to go, but they saw that I might like to go, so they especially prompted me to come. However, going out to eat somewhere else isn't paid-for like eating on campus, and worse yet, it turns out that the place focused on Asian food. I think I've established that I like spending time with p019 and p020, so I really liked the idea of going somewhere and eating with them, but it just didn't make any sense for me to go. I was rather upset by this because I really, really, <em>really</em> wanted to go with them. I like being around fun people, and increasingly as I seclude myself to work on homework, I'm lonely all the time, so I'd love to take people up on an offer to spend time with them, but I still have to be sensible. I know I could always be the one who invited people to hang out, and I could debate this point with you, but as I said at the beginning of this entry, I don't have time for this. The point is that I'm not happy about my missed opportunities to spend time with people. Why is it that I can resist something I want as much as spending time with people even though there are only a few fairly-convincing reasons whereas my addiction victimizes me regularly despite exceptionally persuasive reasons to prevent such an occurrence?

						On a side note, I was providing people with some helpful information about p024's surprise birthday party yesterday when <span class="person p0">someone</span> accidentally sent some texts to the group chat which were actually meant for a different group chat. As it turns out, that other group chat included p024. At first, I just laughed it off, but then I realized that such a mistake could go in the other direction and alert p024 to what was going on. There's still more than a month left before the surprise party, and that's more than enough time for something like that to happen. Admittedly, other people don't say too much, and it isn't very likely that they send a text to the wrong place if it's been a while since anything was said in the group chat, but especially when there's a lot of activity because the day is getting close, I'm quite concerned about the secret leaking out. I told people today to try to avoid saying p024's name or my name in addition to refraining from mentioning "surprise party" in the hopes that any misdirected text wouldn't be too suspicious. I suppose I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that everything works out.

						Although this isn't too necessary, I'll make a brief mention of how I spent some time with p019 and p020 on Friday. We went to a novelty/surplus shop in town as well as the plant section of some other store that sold a bunch of stuff. Afterwards, despite the fact that it was hardly after 4:00, we went to get tacos for dinner. Besides the fact that I didn't have much money, I didn't order anything because only psychopaths and old people (<span class="h1">who are pretty much psychopaths</span>) eat dinner that early. I ended up eating a taco that p019 couldn't eat, though. Throughout all of this, p019 and p020 seemed to think that they had found the perfect person to set me up with: <span class="person p0" data-revisit="replace">Steven</span> (who's a girl despite the masculine name). I didn't do much to encourage them, but ... I didn't do much to <em>dis</em>courage them either. I was keenly aware, however, of the potential to prematurely lead this girl on if I went along with too obvious of an attempt to get us together. As p019 drove us back, her favorite song, Be Bold Like p021, came on. (In case you forgot or I didn't mention it, her boyfriend's name is p021.)
					</section>
					<section>
						Yesterday (the main topic of interest) was a pretty interesting day as well. The plan for today was to go bowling with p019, p020, and their friends, but it turned out that p020 first had to make an impulse buy of a puppy <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>.
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">Personally, I wouldn't consider the purchase of an animal to be something that should be done impulsively, but she (and p019) had been talking about getting pets for quite some time, and I actually think she'll take good care of it. Since dogs aren't allowed in their dorm, the puppy is apparently being stashed at p020's sister's house, and she plans on making frequent visits.</aside>
						Once all of that had been resolved late in the day, though, we did indeed go bowling. Although it sounded like more people might come, there were only two others: a girl named Mattie and Steven. (Steven's presence didn't come as a shock to me.) I found it rather convenient how Steven ended up in the middle back seat which necessitated me sitting next to her. Since I had established that I had essentially no money to spend, once we arrived at the bowling alley, p019 paid for my admission. (She considered it her month-late birthday present to me.)

						I lied for the third time today. Yet again, I had finished next to nothing on a homework assignment (a small packet this time). I tried to fill out a little bit of it during class, but there was still essentially nothing done by the end. The professor began collecting the assignment, but it was kind-of disorderly, so it wasn't too noticeable when I didn't turn anything in. I knew a small amount of points was better than no points, and I was really conflicted on whether I should turn it in, but I decided to try to do a tiny bit of concentrated work on it after class and turn it in to the professor in their office soon after. I didn't get too much more finished, but it wasn't a very hard assignment, so I made a little progress. Before too much time had gone by for the mildly late turn-in to no longer seem innocent, I went to the professor's office (or, more exactly, their neighboring lab). I had intended to just quickly explain to them that I didn't end up getting the assignment to them, but it ended up coming out as that I <em>forgot</em> to get the assignment to them. I'm sure using the correct wording wouldn't have really changed the overall impression I portrayed, but if I try to justify some of the things I do as not lying by citing the exact wording, this incident can't be ignored. In this particular instance, though, I don't quite feel as bad as I might otherwise expect, likely because it was an accident, and I'm more concerned with how I once again dropped the ball on something I have essentially no excuses for not accomplishing. As you should know by now, I'm more than capable of launching into an extended discussion of this, but I'm much too tired to do so, and there's better ways of spending my time, anyway. There's actually something fairly significant that happened yesterday (and maybe you would count the day before), but I'm not going to write about it today.

						Although I'm reluctant to make anything of it, I found it interesting when I saw today that p018 hadn't gotten a haircut. I'm sure you don't understand the significance of that, but it becomes a rather intriguing observation when you take into account that it comes after 1. she had seemed very sure of getting a haircut, and 2. I told her that she looked prettier with longer hair. According to p018, she didn't get her hair cut because her sister who cuts her hair wanted to dye her hair in addition to providing a haircut, so she decided to wait her out. Don't get me wrong: It's totally believable that something like that would happen by coincidence, and I've seen people do a whole lot more without actually being interested in a relationship, and I really am reluctant to make anything of it... but I can't help but find it interesting.

As the time to leave approached, my parents started asking me some things about the party, and it soon leaked out that this surpise birthday party was for a girl and was organized by me. For reasons I can hardly begin to fathom, my dad didn't follow up the discovery of that information with an hour-long lecture about how I need a girlfriend and she seems like a good option (despite not knowing her at all). It was at this time that I also mentioned that I would tell my parents if I got a girlfriend, but they didn't seem to believe me, and they'll likely forget about it soon enough like they did last time.

						Yesterday I got my wisdom teeth taken out. For quite some time now, the dentists have been telling me that I'm going to need to have my wisdom teeth taken out. For reasons I fail to understand, my parents have been resisting allowing me to get them removed until they start hurting; it would seem to me that it would make more sense to have the procedure while things didn't hurt and get it over with rather than wait until I'm in pain for an extended period of time and then follow through. Nevertheless, my mom eventually caved to the pressure from the dentists and decided to have things done this summer. I was never very concerned with any of this, but my mom was oddly worried the whole time. My dad hardly paid attention to what was going on, as usual. The day finally came yesterday, and as is often the case, I wasn't really nervous until right beforehand. As I sat in the chair getting prepared for the procedure, I became slowly more shakey, and I thought to myself, "I'm ready for the sedatives to kick in." The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a numb mouth with gauze, and everything was over; it wasn't really much different from how I would wake up at my computer after suddenly faling asleep from sleep-deprivation. I felt a little dizzy and tired, but it wasn't all that bad. I also didn't embarass myself by acting weird like I've seen on TV many times before. I ended up sleeping for the majority of the ride home, and once I got home, I tried eating some and taking pain pills. Seemingly out of nowhere, I threw up about an hour later, which didn't inspire confidence in the medicine. Today, however, everything seems fine: Naturally, my mouth still hurts, but it's to a degree that I wouldn't have much of a problem going without pain pills (which may cause drowsiness and dizziness. The pain wasn't especially worse yesterday; I just assumed that there was still some numbing in effect). The swelling is hardly noticeable, and there's no discernable bruising. There's minimal bleeding, and the slight dizziness has long worn off. As long as I make sure to take my antibiotics and go easy on my mouth for a while, I don't anticipate any problems. I've heard plenty of stories of things going much worse with wisdom teeth, but I must have gotten a really good surgeon or had it done early enough or something because this isn't very bad at all.

						Today was the first day I didn't talk to p024 at all since early February. A few days ago (since she claimed to not have an opinion on the issue), I told p024 that, although I'd still try to talk to her frequently, I wouldn't try so hard to jam it in if it didn't seem to be working out. This was particularly in response to how my dad might have me working all day and pretty much exclude the possibility of conversation, especially since p024's early job would cause her to go to bed rather early. Ironically, the thing that kept me from talking to her today was my intense concentration on finishing a code generator for my super cool code that can form nearly unlimited unique symbols. (I did get it finished more or less.) Although I doubt that p024 has been effected much at all by this incident, it still makes me a little sad: p024 means a lot to me, and I had such a good streak going. I talked to p018 today, however, and despite spending days being extremely close to decoding the message I gave her (and p022) written in my yet-to-be-named symbol code that I just mentioned, she's only just now starting to get through what the message says. I've been prompting her to hurry up for the past few days, but I've had limited success, and it's driving me crazy especially since she won't make a code for me until she's finished figuring out mine.

						Today was p06's birthday. Naturally, I texted her and we had a pretty good conversation; however, there was one topic which especially caught my attention: As it turns out, even last year, <strong>p06 knew about my attempt to throw her a surprise party <em>the whole time</em>!</strong> I'd like to think that the secret originally slipped out by accident (as opposed to being instantly ratted out by her mom), but regardless of the circumstances, she <em>knew</em>! The whole time I was discussing birthday plans with her mom, the whole time I was debating with her friends the effect of a party on Haiey's comfort level, the whole time I was making an origami elephant to surprise her with, she knew! I swear, despite my expectation of being able to recognize such things, I didn't get the slightest impression that my "surprise" party would actually have been no more surprising than my own 18<sup>th</sup> birthday party. At no point during our conversations did p06's mom or p06 ever reference something that suggested the secret had been compromised, and although I'm careful about drawing conclusions from what I notice, I'm generally very good at noticing things. (It would be too difficult for me to demonstate a definitive lack of evidence, so you're just going to have to take my word for it.) While I was keeping the secret of the surprise party as a way of making sure p06 would be as happy as possible, p06 and her mom were keeping the secret of the lack of surprise for the same reason for me! This has turned my whole world upside down. As it turns out, the person with the mystery phone number who wouldn't tell me their name was actually a guy p06 had gotten close to and had told about the surprise party. Suddenly, the prompts to call off the party take on a whole new meaning: If p06 knew about the party the whole time and had discussed it with the people I talked to, those people must have been directly conveying p06's wishes rather than guessing based on her personality. However, that just begs the question of why p06's mom liked the idea so much both times. If she and p06 had talked about this and she got the impression that p06 legitimately didn't want a party, wouldn't she have tried to discourage me? Maybe she didn't get that impression or maybe, like me, she thought it would be fine if we just didn't go too crazy. Regardless, there's a part of me that's feeling a little bad about pursuing a party after discovering that the prompts by others likely carried much more weight than I realized. But I think I took a fairly reasonable course of action. I consulted her mom and friends; I was going to try to make it fairly low-key; and try as I might, I still have a hard time believing that anyone could have a problem with having a fun time with their friends on a day which just so happened to be personally significant.

						I think I figured out the genders of the kittens. Ignoring the mostly-grown female one, there are 4 male kittens and 3 females. My dad has tried to classify them twice now with doubtful success, but he hasn't tried recently.

						In other news, I realized yesterday (on my own) that the slightly larger number of space-related programs on TV is a result of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first manned moon landing. According to the Google search I just did, it will be exactly 50 years on July 20<sup>th</sup>, but who knows what I'll be doing on that day, so I might as well mention it now. It's pretty pathetic that we've hardly done anything on the moon since we first landed on it. I've been hearing things about maybe getting back to the moon especially for its resources and lower gravity to launch from, but it'll be at least 10 or 20 years before people start making any real progress, so my annoyance with the pace of progress remains. Surely there's some happy medium between tossing around ideas for years and making dangerous short-cuts. Private space companies are the only ones seeming to get anywhere, and they've had a whole lot less time to establish themselves. I wonder which is more likely to happen first: landing people on Mars or beginning to create a reliable presence one the moon. A prediction I have a strong feeling about though is that a cure for aging will be found before we develop interstellar travel. Although most people think of aging as an abstract unstoppable force, it's really just a slow accumulation of specific damage which our species hasn't been motivated to evolve protection against until recently (and evolution is extremely slow). We're already doubling or quadrupling lifespans of certain animals, and our rapidly expanding knowledge of genetics and cellular processes is priming us to develop ways of combatting our own aging. Although I'm not quite as tuned-in to the recent developments of space travel, looking at the most advanced engine (an ion thrust prototype which might be able of reaching 40,000 meters per second) and considering the distance to the nearest star (Proxima Centauri 4.244 light-years away), it would take us 31,808 years to reach interstellar status. Even if radical advancements allowed us to go 1,000&times; faster in the relatively near future, I feel rather secure in the idea that we'll be able to pin-point genetic changes to enhance our longevity long before we'll be doing anything but accelerating nanobots to stars with lasers (or something else lame like that). That being said, artificial intelligence surpassing our own could quite possibly happen before curing aging, and once that happens, who knows what will become of the world. I would still expect the intelligence to cure aging before creating interstellar travel, though (you know, assuming we're not all enslaved or killed).

						I have to stop caring so much about p018. I've been wanting to talk about this a whole lot for a few days now, but there's always classes, and p022 is never very far away, so I can't get into this without her figuring things out and getting worried and/or upset. I've been especially worried about upsetting p022 these past few days, but I'll get to that in a little bit. Right now, however, I'm not completely dead tired, p022 is asleep, and I really really need to address this. More than that, I have to finish this entry tonight: Besides the fact that this is weighing on me enough to supercede all other priorities by quite a bit (even, regrettably, the super secret stuff I'm overdue on doing for p022), I don't know when I'll ever be able to get back to this, so finishing it later isn't an option. I'm almost certain that this is going to be a rather large entry, and I'm equally confident that it's going to take me a very long time to get through it all, but I don't care if I have to work through the night and stand while I'm typing to make sure I don't fall asleep; <span class="e-o3">this has to get done.</span>

						<span class="e16">I am so mad at myself.</span> After taking a ridiculously long time to get through by bedtime routine like I always do, I was tired to the point that I was tipping over while standing. I recovered slightly, but as I thought about spending the rest of the night talking about how I need to stop caring so much about p018 and related topics, I thought that I probably shouldn't abuse my body to that extent, and if I ended up getting even more tired, it would be next to impossible for me to progress in the entry, so I decided to take an hour nap which would leave me more than 4 hours to work on the entry. I set four alarms on my phone, all within a few minutes of each other, so I wouldn't be inclined to fall back asleep after one alarm went off, and if I snoozed one (I always plan on only snoozing alarms at first), I wouldn't fall asleep in the 10-minute snoozing period because a bunch of other alarms would be going off. It all seemed like a good plan, that is, until I slept through all of the alarms and found myself somehow waking up a little early in the morning, facing the extremely low likelihood that I'll find sufficient time to make any progress at all on the entry today or through the weekend (not to mention indefinitely into the future). p022 always looks forward to spending Fridays and the weekend with me, and I can't ask her to give that up without making her really worried about me, and for reasons I was going to explain, I just can't get into this stuff with her right now, so I can't be suspicious in any way (which would be a struggle regardless), and I don't know how I'm going to get through typing much of anything. I should've just given up my sleep; I don't know how else I'm going to be able to make the time to finish. I'm dying on the inside, and I really really need to talk about this stuff, both for my current mental health and for when I inevitably let p018 and p022 read it, but I don't know how I'm going to do it. I guess I'll just tack what I was going to say onto the end of this entry and see if I can somehow manage to find a way to say what I need to say.

						As I was leading into before, p018 and I have been drifting apart. As p022 and I began spending more and more time together, p018 and I began spending less and less time together. This semester, p018 is trying to do more things with her life, and she's greatly expanded her circle of friends, so there's much less opportunity for alone time with her. We're several weeks into the semester, and I can count on one hand how many times I've been alone with p018 for longer than a few minutes. Every day, there's classes, meals eaten without p018, and then going back to p022's apartment. I want to make it clear that I enjoy spending time with p022 (obviously), but it's hard when she's just about the only person I'm ever around. If days were expanded to 48 hours and I spent the same amount of time with p022, I wouldn't have the slightest problem with being around her that much since I would have a whole other 24 hours to work on things, hang out with other people, or maybe spend even more time with p022 because she's great company. However, days aren't that long, and in order for me to make time for one thing, I have to lessen the amount of time spent on something else. I can't shorten the time spent on things like classes and eating (although I sometimes do to some degree to my detriment), and I don't spend enough time doing other things to really make a difference if I gave them up without giving up a whole lot of things, so all I'm left to work with is my large amount of time with p022. The thing is, p022 doesn't like the idea of giving up very much time with me. Although these numbers aren't very accurate (since it's hard to come up with accurate numbers), let's say for instance that p022 and I spend 10 hours a day together: For me, I wouldn't start to get upset about being separated too much until we started going below something like 4 or 5 hours; however, it would start affecting p022 at around 8 or 9 hours. That doesn't mean that I think 8 or 9 hours is too much or anything, but it does mean that I have much less time to work with before I start upsetting p022. That being said, p022's tolerance for greater amounts of separation would surely increase if she were doing things with other people during that time, but considering how the person she's most likely to do stuff with is p018, that doesn't help me much when trying to talk to p018 alone. I don't want to leave p022 sad and alone, but I also want to be able to have meaningful interactions with other people. Worse yet, I can't even really message p018 for a kind of digital alone time because it might make p022 feel bad: Ever since I made the mistake of comparing p022's appearace to p018's, she's been really self-conscious when p018 is around and worried about what I think of her. She tries to hide it, and she doesn't like feeling that way, but I seeded her mind with that, and it just won't go away. I know all too well what it's like to feel something that you don't want to feel, so I can't get upset with her, but as I've said before, it makes me scared to take steps to decrease my separation from p018. p022 and I talked about this exact problem, and she (sincerely) told me that I shouldn't let her stand in the way of my friendship with p018, but it's hard for me to just go along with that because I know feelings don't just magically disappear, and I really don't want to hurt p022. I wish I could snap my fingers and make those feelings go away, but I can't, and I don't know how else to fix it. Fairly early on into our relationship, p022 and I discussed how we would handle if one of us got jealous (which was particularly relevant for me, considering the proportion of my friends who are female), and we weren't really able to come up with any definitive solution, but we resolved to work through it if it ever became a problem. Little did we know that this would become an issue with our mutual best friend. In an effort to vent my feelings without making p022 question herself, I've tried to substitute p024 for p018, but besides the fact that I don't like the thought that I'm just using p024 as a substitute, if p022 finds out that I'm talking to p024 about anything serious, she feels bad because she thinks I can't trust her with things. There's just no winning.

						On Sunday, I discussed with p022 how I was worried about how emotionally dependent she had gotten on me and (after putting some space in between) how I'd like to spend a little more time on campus since I've been feeling kind-of closed-off from people. (Technically, the feelings were somewhat more substantial than my wording might suggest, but I didn't want to overwhelm p022 and make her feel like I didn't want to be with her.) I had mentioned this a little bit a few times before (pretty much just the spending more time on campus part), and each time, she felt bad, and in a rather detached and/or defeated tone of voice, she would encourage me to stay at school more often. Each time, I would tell her how spending the night at school isn't all that glamorous and how I still really liked being around her, but it would be a struggle to convince her that I didn't want to get away from her all the time, and I'm not sure I ever really convinced her so much as made her a little less upset and then let the conversation fade away. This time, however, I may have been slightly more direct, and the build-up from the previous instances of this conversation really got to her, so she got to the point where she was considering having me spend a whole week at school and was wondering whether I still wanted her as my girlfriend. I insisted that I put a lot of thought into whether I wanted to be with her before I actually decided to be, and worrying about the ease with which I can upset her or hoping to be around people more often isn't going to make me want to throw away a relationship that means so much to me. I seemed to have more or less defused the total extent of her fears, but she still insisted that I stay at school that night. I tried telling her that I didn't want her to make a snap decision like that, but time left before dinner was running short, and she didn't seem very inclined to change her mind, so I had to go along with it. <span class="e-o1">I felt so awful for upsetting her like that and making her feel like it was necessary to abruptly give me extra time on campus.</span> I cried a number of times, and about every 30 minutes for the rest of the night, I messaged her that I loved her. Since the next night would be when I could sleep in if I didn't stay with p022, she wanted me to stay that night as well (which would've been normal), but I wasn't able to get what I needed for that many days before we had to leave Sunday night, and p018 ended up "kidnapping" p022 for lunch in an effort to make her feel better the next day, so p022 never ended up getting the stuff either. As I was walking p022 back to her car after our classes, she gave me the option of either going home with her right then to get my stuff and come back or staying until after dinner and then going back and staying the night with her. I didn't have much time to think about what to do, and it would've been nice to be able to sleep (and talk to p018), but I just couldn't make p022 spend another night alone, so I decided to go with the second option. p022 seemed fairly happy that I wanted to stay with her, and that's what happened, but as my need to do damage control lessened, it was easy to see that I was no closer to finding a solution to my original problem than I was before I mentioned anything. <span class="e-a2">I just don't know how I can make p022 understand that I can want to be around other people while also wanting to be around her.</span> I may keep mentioning that I don't want to always be at her apartment when I'm not in class, but that's just because I/we never stick around. You may not constantly want a drink of water under normal circumstances, but if you never got one, it would only be a matter of time before it became a rather prevalent desire. <span class="h4">I legitimately enjoy spending time with p022,</span> and I don't say that just to make her feel better; I really mean it. Moreover, it's not like I was coerced into staying with her in the first place. I just don't want her to define my entire existence, and I don't know how I can tell her that without making her think that I'm tiring of being in a relationship with her. On a side note, p022 rather liked how I said "I love you" so many times and so has been trying to perpetuate it, but as I have told her in the past, I want those words to mean something when I say them, so I want to use them conservatively, but now I'm wondering if I'll be able to maintain that without disappointing her.

						It's at this point that I think I ought to say how having alone time with people is extremely important to bonding with those people. Although talking in a group is nice and can bring out different sides of people, there are certain limitations to how close you can get in those settings because you have to compete for talking time, and you can only get into things as serious as the least close person allows you to (not to mention that bringing up hard things is easier to do in a more intimate setting). I really liked the people I knew in high school, and I felt pretty close to them, but there were huge parts of my life that they knew nothing about because I'd essentially never see any of them one-on-one, and I didn't want to tell them things like how one of their friends is my ex-girlfriend who won't talk to me when she's sitting right there. I knew my primary group of friends in high school for two years and yet it was p03 who I only really knew for one year who I felt the closest to and really wanted to read my journal; that's because, although I was never especially alone with p03, we had classes where we could sit next to each other and quietly discuss things while in the midst of disinterested people, and that was enough. With the rest of my friends, we only really had band and lunches together, so there were few opportunities to even be "alone" in a crowd, especially considering how none of them were next to me in band (since seating was more predefined than it was in regular classes). I sat next to or very close to p010 in band for three years, but it wasn't until the later part of the third year that we started getting close, in large part, because of the extra things we did for band which were conducive to alone time. I learned more about her in those last few months than I did the whole previous two and a half years. In college, I wasn't sure whether I'd let p11 read my journal because it had been too long since I had known him, but based almost exclusively on our long car rides to and from school, I decided that I could trust him with it. When I got to know p024, I didn't think I'd get very close to her because of how completely different she was from me, but that all changed when we spent almost a solid week spending many hours alone together. With p018 and p022, we've almost never discussed important things when we weren't talking one-on-one; even when it was just the three of us and we didn't care if both people knew, we would almost exclusively wait to tell both people until we could talk to them individually. <span class="h3">Alone time is absolutely essential to becoming close with people, and without it, it's just not possible to have a particularly strong connection.</span> p024 used to tell me everything that was going on in her life, and we would message each other all the time (since she wasn't at school to meet up with). However, when I started getting caught up in my time with p022 and p018, the messages decreased, the volunteered information decreased, and the time spent with her (when she came back to school) was essentially nonexistent. If I hadn't run into her that one day at lunch, I would've had no idea what kind of struggles she was going through, and I may have never realized how severe our separation had become, not to mention that she was dropping out.
					</section>
					<section data-revisit="finish">
						p018 and I used to be really close. Even before I got to know her really well, I would plot ways of "coincidentally" encountering her because she was just a really great person to be around. p018 jokes about being a third wheel, but she's much more than that, both to me and p022. <span class="e-m1">Even though she used to be an arm-breaking, valuables-burying, house-burning, school-skipping, delinquent in her younger years,</span> she has become (and probably already was to some degree) just about the kindest, most reliable, most understanding person you could ever hope to meet. My cautiousness of getting close to people made sure it took a fairly long time, but I eventually let her past my most heavily fortified barriers. (I know this is all review for you.) Another thing you already know is that my relationships with people mean everything to me: There's a lot of cool things I do, and there's practical matters such as school, but when it comes down to it, people are what matter the most to me. There's a reason that I deprived myself of sleep for a solid week in order to write up messages of how I felt for my high school friends; it wasn't an accident that I spent so much time trying to finish a website for p03 that I fell asleep in class and didn't study for a test which I ended up failing; it's not because I just love typing so much that I pursue the conclusion of this entry at the expense of everything else. These are a few of the many instances in which I had to decide where my priorities lay, and I chose my friends without hesitation. Given the importance I place on relationships, getting close to someone is a big deal, and that was no exception with p018. Although some things would be harder to bring up than others, we would talk about absolutely anything, whether it be school stresses, family concerns, insecurities, Mario Kart, <span class="elaborate">rodents</span>;<aside data-heading="Explanation">That's mainly a reference to the "gerbil" codeword.</aside> we would get into everything. Especially at night when we were getting into the important stuff, we would talk for hours upon hours, potentially until dawn; however, it's not like that anymore. The only times I ever find out anything is wrong is when p022 passes the information along or when I'm around her and catch her in the midst of a problem before she can compose herself. She doesn't seem to not want me to know what's going on, but we basically never talk except sometimes in a group (which isn't conducive to serious conversations), and those conversations almost universally end up in some variety of battle between p018 and me (partly because it's fun, partly to put on a show, partly because that's what people expect from us). It's gotten to the point that <span class="elaborate">I don't even know whether p018's dad has cancer.</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration">At some point, possibly during the one time this semester when I had a long conversation alone with p018, p018 told me how her dad might have cancer and how doctors are currently running tests to find out for sure. At the time, the results were supposed to come in within something like a few days, definitely within a week. As you might imagine, it's been quite some time since then.</aside> I assume he either doesn't have it or has a treatable variety since I haven't noticed p018 looking worried, but this isn't something a close friend should have to guess at. I don't even know the frivolous stuff like how difficult it was for her to get first place in a race on Mario Kart or what new picture of a swimming gerbil she saw. In the group chat with p018, p022, and me, there used to be a sizable amount of conversation, but now, there might be one picture or comment in a week, and I already told you about messaging her individually (although p018 and p022 message each other all the time). Besides how I'd like to learn about p018's life, I've been accumulating a bunch of things I really want to talk to p018 about (and which I can't talk to p022 about right away). It's not that I never plan on telling p022 those things, but some stuff bothers me even after I talk about it with p022, and other things have the potential to hurt p022, so I want to take some time to make sure I do things right. I worry about p022 interpreting my hesitation to tell her everything right away as evidence that I don't trust her (which wouldn't be unprecedented for her), but she has similar conversations with p018 relating to me, so I don't think it should be too hard for her to understand (hopefully). Regardless <span class="elaborate obvious">future</span><aside data-heading="Admission" data-date="2022/4/24">I didn't really want to say this because it would likely make you doubt the accuracy of the remainder of this entry, but from this point forward, my thoughts are recollected over two years later based on my formidable memory and the notes I made much closer to the original date of this entry. My notes were pretty thorough, and they did a good job of reminding me of the situation, and if there was a part where I wasn't sure exactly what the extent of my feelings were, I went with the more conservative possibility. I wish I would've been able to finish this all at once like I had originally planned, and it may have done a better job of representing exactly what was going through my head at the time (I say "may" because I wouldn't have written this much if I had finished it all at once), but that's not how it worked out, and I think I still did a respectable job of staying true to the February 21, 2020 version of myself. Also, just to be clear, everything is still written as it would be if I had actually finished saying everything in one day.</aside>,

						I just want to quit feeling so dead inside. Between the stuff with p018 and the stuff related to my addiction and the school work which never ends and causes me to be in the lab every day for hours, I'm getting the life sucked out of me. I'm worried about getting a bad grade in certain classes because I haven't been turning things in even though I've been doing massive amounts of work on my own time; my internal conflict about what's okay to do with p022 has been weighing on me with a crushing force as the likelihood of certain things happening has increased; and I still haven't managed to even get very close to finishing saying everything I want to say about p018, so I've been forced to continue carrying that burden with no outlet and no resolution. A lot of stuff has been going on, some of which is rather important, but <span class="e-o2">since when have I been able to talk about important things when they happen in my life?</span> I have an exceptional ability to push things down and keep going, so I've been keeping myself held together fairly well, but that doesn't mean that these things don't still bother me, and there are many times when I'm nearly overcome with a debilitating combination of dread, anxiety, sadness, and just overall hopelessness. Even when I try to think about things logically, I don't really see any way of getting through my problems unscathed, and this lingering sense of inescapable disaster has been killing me for weeks. My mind tries to cope by turning off my emotions even more, but even though it does help a great deal, some things matter too much to me to be fully suppressed. Although there are still times when I can find the joy in things, there are huge sections of my day when I'm fighting off despairing thoughts and, as a consequence, conducting myself in a rather lifeless, coldly logical way. Despite how much effort I may put into trying to type things in here, all I ever have time for is an entry as long as this one (if I'm lucky) before I pass out from sleep-deprivation and wake up to realize that I still haven't finished my homework. It's not like I'm spending the rest of the time goofing off; as I think about the most recent sinks of my time, I come back to how I live in the lab, but that doesn't do me any good if I don't have any tangible evidence of the work I put in for them to grade. In addition to that, I've spent many hours on many days stepping p022 through how to work out questions on homework for the classes we share, and in the meantime, I haven't been finishing that same homework because I can't explain and write at the same time. I've brought this up with her, and she tried to get me to stop helping her with homework completely, but it's against my nature to let people fend for themselves when I know I can help, so I'm trying to figure out a milder solution, but compromises don't necessarily come easily; I have to do something, though, because it's been a real issue. In summary, my time has been going into a black hole which leaves me little opportunity to solve any problems, assuming I'm even able to solve them. One thing I keep coming back to is how I haven't finished the entry regarding p018. Sure, there's a bunch of other problems that keep compounding including ones I haven't even mentioned here, but the February 21<sup>st</sup> entry is a big deal not only to myself but to p018, and if she has meant anything to me, <span class="h4">I owe it to her to get that done.</span> However, as the immediate intensity of the feelings slightly decreased and the necessity of me completing homework increased, I've started putting off when I work on it to the point that I strongly suspect that I won't have it finished any earlier than sometime during spring break (after this week). Before I start thinking of spring break as my time to accomplish stuff, though, my parents finally bought <span class="elaborate">a run-down house</span><aside data-heading="Reminder">This is the house that our neighbor had been trying to sell us and that we had been doing hard labor on fixing up over the summer. As it turned out, there were a bunch of liens on the house or something, so my dad didn't want to get it until that had been sorted out and he didn't have to worry about getting stuck with paying a bunch of money.</aside> they've been looking at for a long time with money that materialized out of thin air, and my dad has been excitedly planning all the ways he can put my slave labor to use. That's not to mention the fact that I can barely accomplish anything on a regular basis while at home. If I'm not able to finish the entry over break, will I be able to finish it when I come back to school? Wondering about how long this is going to be dragged out is yet another source of stress for me, and once again, my optimism on the outcome is nonexistent. Dealing with all of this has been really really hard on me, and suppressing my emotions can only get me so far. I just want to quit feeling so dead inside.

						This may come as a shock to you, but a lot has been going on in my life, and I haven't had time to talk about it. Hopefully, I'll use the daily events I record to give you somewhat meaningful descriptions of what has happened to me, but if you need a summary, here's some stuff: I coordinated the revival of the relationship between my dad and my half-sister, Shawny; I gave up on trying to get a biology job because I didn't want to lose p022 on her deadline of September 15<sup>th</sup>; no normal job wanted me either except the Walmart p022 works at, most likely because she could put in a good word for me (especially since the bigger Walmart didn't want me for anything); I moved into p022's apartment, much to the irritation of my dad, but I remain a guest as opposed to a co-inhabitant; I don't feel close to anyone except p022 and maybe p024 because I've spent almost all of my time doing stuff for my dad, talking to p022, or looking for a job, (and not talking to anyone) and I only have some attachment to p024 because I've been trying to make sure I'm there for her in case she has some troubles (although I'm not complaining); my life is dominated by work now, and I get a sick feeling when I contemplate a future of endless toil <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration">I was completely caught off guard with how time-consuming a full-time job would be, and I can't help but think to myself how I'd rather live as a hobo than spend the rest of my life doing nothing but work.</aside>; and more recently, I'm worried about getting fired for not learning to do my job fast enough (learning how to make myself go faster, not learning how to do the job), as has been the general theme for essentially all of my life. I actually started this entry over three weeks ago, but everything continues to be pretty much the same, so I thought I'd move up the date. Technically, I have enough time to finish an entry this long in less than three weeks, but I don't typically work on my journal while p022's around because I don't want to worry and/or upset her, and if you only count the time I have to myself away from p022 and not doing something I have to do, <span class="h3">taking over three weeks to type something this long really is representative of that time.</span> <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration">Technically, I have slightly more time even with those conditions because I can't always use my time to work on this since it takes me a little while to get into the journal zone, and by the time I do that, my time might be over. Also, I may use a small amount of my time to read an article or play a short game on my phone, but that's not too common.</aside> I've worked on this almost exclusively on my lunch breaks, but I also try to eat during that time, and since p022 gets sad if I don't talk to her during my breaks and I can't talk to people and type journal entries at the same time and she's almost always available to talk, very little gets done. Since many of you are surely tiring of listening to me complain about what little time I have, let me add a little to some of my current thoughts and feelings.
					</section>
					<section>
						Just kidding. I had started writing some extra stuff which actually described what's going on, but you know how I like to ramble, and it soon became abundantly clear that I'm never going to finish this if I say anything but the bare minimum. Touching on a few of the main things, my worries about getting fired from this job have been intensifying, especially since <span class="elaborate">I have so much riding on having a job</span>;
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							What happens if I lose my job:
							<ol>
								<li><strong>I have to move back home.</strong> If I don't have an income, I can't pay for even a shared apartment, and p022 doesn't have the means or the will to compensate. I would have to go back to living at a place I strongly dislike.</li>
								<li><strong>I lose p022.</strong> One of p022's biggest concerns is that I won't be able to make a living for myself, let alone her, because I'm too slow, and she'll have to do everything. She's almost broken up with me because of this on numerous occasions, and if I do anything to support that belief (such as lose my job), the result probably won't be immediate, but I have little doubt in my mind that my relationship with p022 will have no future. There's also the consideration that p022 can't handle a long-distance relationship very well, and that's what we'd have to go back to after I have to move back home since I can't pay to live with her. In the best-case scenario, I almost immediately get another job, and our relationship is only set back months as I try to regain her confidence.</li>
								<li><strong>I can't pay for my student loans.</strong> Although things have been delayed because of the coronavirus, it won't be long until I need to start making payments on the fairly substantial student loans I've accumulated. Obviously, if I don't have an income, I won't be able to make those payments.</li>
							</ol>
						</aside>
						I don't confide in anyone anymore, <span class="elaborate">including p022</span>;<aside data-heading="Elaboration">First off, we have significantly less time together than we used to, so there's not much time to get into problems. Besides that, I have three main types of problems: problems relating to p022 (which obviously require being handled delicately); parent problems (which just make p022 irritated if she hears about them <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration within an elaboration">p022 has gotten fed up with how my parents (primarily my dad) treat me, and so she gets quite upset on my behalf when she hears about yet another thing she considers ridiculous. However, besides the fact that I don't like putting people in a bad mood, p022's hostility has a tendency to bleed over into other things, and that puts me in a rather precarious situation. I'd rather deal with things on my own than get p022 angry. I've told her at least some of this, but I have no reason to believe that anything has changed.</aside>); and job problems (which would make p022 question whether there's a future with us, as I said with how much I have riding on having a job). When you put topics that p022 won't react well to together with no time to ease into things, you end up with just keeping p022 out of the loop.</aside> and you already know how I don't have any time for anything. There's also all of the problems I had previously, but the other problems consume so much of my life that I don't have time to think about anything else that's wrong. Yesterday, p022's apartment complex had a lame Halloween party, and when I was trying to figure out if there was a reason p022 was staying so long not doing much of anything, she told me how she wanted to give me some exposure to people. Although I didn't say anything out loud, I laughed to myself because feeling secluded (potentially) was so far down my list of problems that it hadn't even crossed my mind. Of the preexisting problems, the one (if you can call it "one") that bothers me the most is the continuing difficulties with p022. Naturally, there's not enough time to get into all of those problems, but I still have my list of concerns which I still haven't told p022 about, and we never have serious conversations anymore because we're never together enough to get into them. In the meantime, I continue getting the cold should every few days, and it tears me up inside. Although I'm not going to say that I always do things perfectly, I've never ever ever <em>ever</em> given her the cold shoulder; why does she do it to me all the time? It's one thing if you're upset about something and need a little time to get over it, and I know I have an abnormally high tolerance for potentially upsetting things, but how can I be upsetting her that much that often? She didn't use to give me the cold shoulder all the time. Have I become a more irritating person? Has she gotten sick of looking past my flaws? She tells me that people in a relationship always upset each other from time to time, and maybe some people can't help it, but I refuse to believe that we'll always have problems. There are issues I have with p022, and depending on what they are, they can have a relatively large effect on me, but I don't get mad at her and/or decide that I'm going to avoid talking to her for the rest of the day. As a matter of fact, as a way of trying to not make things worse, I've gotten pretty good at just acting normal whenever p022 upsets me. (Technically, I was already good; I just made myself implement it more fully because I wanted to limit p022 noticing anything is wrong.) There are still times when she notices, but I misdirect her, and she lets it go because I don't make it seem important enough to pursue. However, no matter how hard I try to ignore the things that upset me and do whatever I can to make p022 happy, she still gets fed up with me rather often, and it really hurts me.
					</section>
					<section>
						In summary, I hate my life right now. I'm worried about losing my job, and I'm worried about living with it and the lack of free-time indefinitely. I'm worried about p022 leaving me, but being with her leaves me hurt and/or upset pretty often (but I'm still not to the point where I'm considering breaking up with her). I have no one to vent to, and I can't even vent in this journal. And then there's the general weight of all of the other problems combined which I can hardly bring to the forefront of my mind because my entire existence is defined by my job and p022, so there's no place for anything else. I go through each day bogged down by life, but I put on a happy face so I don't make things worse. In brief spurts, I steal some time to contemplate my situation, but I invariably come to the conclusion that I don't know what to do. I look to the future, and although my mind has a resilient tendency towards optimism, past events tell me that I have more of the same in store. I know you hear it a lot, but I really do have a whole lot more to say; I just don't have the time to say it. This barely scratches the surface of what's going on and how I'm feeling, but I need to spend my lunches doing other things like looking for other jobs or doing student loan exit counceling or maybe even just taking a second to decompress. I hate what's become of my life, but I have to do whatever little things I can to slowly nudge things in the right direction or else this really will be my life forever. I'm just ready for this phase to be over.

						I don't know how much longer I can keep pushing down my feelings for p022's sake. It seems that no matter what I do, p022's going to get upset with me, and I just have to accept it.

					<section>
						I can't help but think I moved in with p022 too early. Yesterday, p022 left to take a campus tour with her mom of what's likely to be her pharmacy school next year. Because of this, I'm going to be alone in the apartment for an indefinite number of days. p022 misses me, and I'm all for being in her company, ... but I can't help but feel free. When I first started college, I could suddenly go wherever I wanted, eat whatever I wanted, spend my free time however I wanted, and be accountable to no one; it was a level of freedom I had never experienced before, and I loved it. There were still limitations with school, my budget, and how far my feet could take me, but I could be my own person and live my own life. Now that I've graduated college and moved out of my parents' house I have the potential to live a truly independent life, but because I'm living with p022, everything I do needs to be done with her in mind. When I go shopping for food, I have to get the food p022 prefers (or food that I can eat on my own in between meals); when I get off of work, I need to come right home because p022 is waiting for me and wants attention; when I'm at home I can't experiment with anything because p022 wants to (perpetually) cuddle and watch Netflix, and she gets upset if I so much as use one hand to look something up on my phone during a lull. I was hoping I'd get some time to do things after I got her those Diamond Dotz picture things which she has to work on independently (that hope was separate from the reason I got them), but instead, she gets upset if I don't rub her back and talk to her the whole time. I'm relatively optimistic that that specific scenario might be able to be changed if I talked to p022 about it (more firmly), but I'd still need to handle things very delicately, and that would still leave a massive amount of time where the problem remains unresolved.
					</section>
					<section>
						I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that <span class="h3">I'm more myself at work than I am at the apartment</span>: I talk to a bunch of people; I experiment with things like barcodes and cooler (as opposed to freezer) door handles; I develop streamlined sign-out sheets to make everyone's life easier ... I've conditioned myself to accept home life as being 100% about p022, so it doesn't suck the life out of me like it used to, but I'd like to have more time to myself than what I can squeeze in during a break at work. With p022 gone right now, I feel like there's nothing I can't do. If I want to go somewhere, I can just go; if I want to try out some new food, I can do it; if I want to reprogram my decoder because Mrs. Padgett's birthday is tomorrow <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration"></aside>, there's nothing stopping me. Add to that the fact that I have a little more time off of work because my hours were temporarily decreased <span class="elaborate obvious">explanation</span><aside data-heading="Explanation"></aside>, and I feel on top of the world. It's like starting college except better because I don't have homework (per se), I can drive places, and I have a little more money to spend on things (primarily my choice of food).
					</section>
					<section>
						I think part of the problem is that I haven't gotten to figure out what I want from living away from home. Whereas p022 has had a bunch of time to figure out what she likes to eat and how she wants things arranged and what type of routine suits her best, I haven't figured that stuff out yet, so when I moved in, it was less of a merging and more of a conforming to what she wanted. I'm still in the experimental phase whereas p022 has already settled on what's best, and she's not much one for change in the first place. For those of you wondering how this differs from when I lived with p022 during college, it doesn't much except for how I don't have a different place that's mine anymore (my dorm room), I'm paying to live here, and I'm not in as much fear of her breaking up with me for other reasons, so I can focus on this.
					</section>
					<section>
						Onward from when I started feeling isolated over a year ago, I haven't felt much at home at the apartment. Before, it made more sense that the apartment wasn't mine because I was kind-of living there in secret, and p022 was paying for everything. When I was planning on moving in during the summer after college, I thought we'd move into a different apartment so we could establish ourselves at the same time or, at the very least, we'd have a thorough reevaluation of the existing apartment and figure out how I'd fit in; however, we did neither. I just changed where I slept, and some things were pushed aside to make room for little more than my bare essentials. I still have a suitcase full of clothes and stuff in the trunk of my car because there's not enough room for it in between all of p022's stuff (and I don't have that much stuff). Until a month ago, I didn't even have a place for the clothes I did bring in; they would just sit in stacks or in a pile on the closet floor. Right now, p022 is in <del>Alabama</del> <span class="afterthought">(actually Arkansas)</span> scouting out her living options if she decides to go to pharmacy school there. In other words, she's starting to make decisions on her own about where both of us are going to spend the next four years of our lives. At least we'll get established at the same time this time.

With p022 in Alabama for a little while, I have a chance to finish up the entries I mentioned (come on, you knew I didn't finish those in one day when you saw the length of them), and I don't think there's going to be a better opportunity to say what I need to say for quite some time. <span class="e-a2">I really don't want to do this to her</span>, but if I don't, not only will I be doing an injustice to myself but I'll also be doing an injustice to p022 because I'll have built up all of this stuff and she won't have had a chance to do anything about it. Maybe I'll be lucky and this will be one of the times when she's really understanding, but I don't want to rely on that. Like I said on January 1<sup>st</sup>, though, I feel like we're in a position where our relationship might be able to handle some problems, so I'm hoping p022 doesn't jump to the thought that we need to take a break from each other. I'm really worried, though, that we'll start to make a few changes but then stagnate (as has happened many times before), and then I'm in a worse position because I can't bring anything up for a long time without seeming pushy or unable to be pleased, at which time p022 will be much more inclined to think that I should live my life without her. (A good example of this is when I tried to address feeling isolated at the apartment.) If p022 shuts down, I'm going to have to go back to hiding everything again until things start to calm down, except that that will be much more difficult to do because she would then know the extent of my ability to keep things to myself and so she wouldn't be very inclined to trust when things started to seem like they were getting better, and even if it wouldn't be extra difficult to do, it would still be <em>really</em> hard on me to go another few months pretending like everything is fine. I'm also worried that we'll trade places and p022 will become the one hiding stuff. I've seen what happens when p022 tries to hide things, and I can tell you that she's not as good at it as me: Whereas I can completely transform just about every aspect of my behavior to seem like I'm okay, p022 can't sustain that very long, but then when I notice that something's wrong, she thinks the thing to do is refuse to tell me what's wrong (sometimes directly) and just let it fester until she's giving me the cold shoulder every day. Moreover, as far as I can tell, when p022 is trying to hide something from me, she has no intention of telling me what's wrong at some point in the future (unless not hiding things as well is her way of bringing it up) whereas I always plan on addressing the issue at some point in the future if it actually matters to me. I'm not saying that I'm perfect at handling this kind of situation, and there have been times when p022 gets the impression that something might be wrong, but I usually make it seem insignificant enough that she's willing to move on or, if she persists, I always tell her what I'm thinking even if I don't think it's time. (It's worth noting, though, that there's not always something wrong when she thinks there is.) We both agreed that it's best not to keep things from each other, but I have a hard time sticking to that universally when I've found time and again that timing is everything, and <span class="elaborate">p022 has even admitted it in at least one instance</span>.
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration"></aside>
						I don't know p022's rationale for occasionally hiding things besides just not wanting to hurt my feelings (which is debatably valid because, when it's something that results in the cold shoulder, that hurts quite a bit anyway). I don't want to take turns hiding things, though; I want us to calmly discuss our points of view and come to a compromise that we're both satisfied with. <span class="h3">My biggest fear with p022 isn't that we'll have problems between us; it's that she'll get fed up with the problems (or overwhelmed) and she'll stop working with me to find a solution.</span> A secondary worry is that she'll be too set in the ways she does things to be able to adapt to include me. A tertiary worry is that she won't know what she wants out of a compromise, so I have to rely on stumbling across what she wants or else face the prospect of never making her happy <span class="elaborate obvious">elaboration</span>.
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">It's actually fairly common for p022 to not know what she wants, and it makes things very difficult on me. It's not unusual for people to not know themselves well enough to know everything that's going on inside their head and what would make that change, and I'm not saying p022 is particularly bad in this area, but you can imagine how hard it is for me to try to employ my non-existent mind-reading abilities to determine what I should do and continue employing them to evaluate what ends up being effective or not and why. p022 likes to use the excuse "I'm a girl" to explain her difficulties in determining what she wants and her tendency to sometimes completely change her mind for seemingly no reason, but even if I believed girls were ordinarily predisposed to that, it wouldn't give them the right to expect others to know what they don't even know themselves. <span class="h3">I'm not angry</span>; I just don't think that's fair, and I'd much rather a person try to work with me to figure out what they want rather than just tell me to rough it and judge me on the results of my guess.</aside>
						Regardless, as I've been working on entries, it's become abundantly clear that I have too many pent-up emotions to continue keeping things to myself. I'd much rather ease her into things slowly, but it's also become abundantly clear that there's almost never a good time to say something, and it would take <em>way</em> too long to ease into everything. I don't know how p022's going to react &mdash; I feel like there's going to be some crying &mdash; but this needs to be resolved. I hope I don't completely mess everything up.

						As it turns out, work still uses up a huge amount of time even when p022 isn't around. Particularly since I can't crank things out tonight because there's so many chores I need to do before p022 gets back tomorrow, there's no chance of me finishing the journal entries I need to before p022's presence slows me down. This is bad. I don't know what I'm going to do.

						I just remembered that p022's brother's birthday is in February. If it's like last year, p022 is going to be increasingly sad leading up to it (I noticed her sad today, probably for that reason) and then sad for a little while afterwards. I don't think she'll be able to handle any entries for the whole month of February. This is even more bad.

						Although I stayed mostly happy throughout the day and there was at least some cool stuff, I wasn't nearly as excited about my birthday as I usually am. Did I not build up the anticipation enough? Am I somehow caring less about my birthday because I'm older? Were other things subconsciously deadening me inside? I don't know what the deal was, but it was rather disappointing. Something I found interesting was how, even though it was my birthday, I still spent a large percentage of the time trying to figure out what p022 wanted to do; I even had a hard time thinking of what I wanted to do (although having a tendency of only coming up with solitary activities factored in there as well). It seems that I've rather effectively conditioned myself to be perpetually vigilant in my unending quest to satisfy p022's desires. At one point on my birthday, I'm pretty sure I upset p022, and I had my theories about the possible cause, but unsurprisingly, she refused to so much as admit that she was upset, so I was left to engage in wild speculation while hoping for the best.
					</section>
					<section>
						Considering how it's past February, you may be wondering whether I ever ended up telling p022 about my problems. I doubt it comes as much of a shock to find out that I did not. As has been the case for a long time, whenever something happens to make me more motivated to say something, it's a bad time to get into it, and whenever there's a good time to get into it, I'm content enough to not want to stir things up by bringing up such a difficult topic. (That's not to mention how I still have little hope of finishing the journal entries which would be the most thorough way of expressing my feelings.) Moreover, at least recently, it seems that my mind has gotten fed up with stressing over all of my problems, so it's detached itself from my emotions related to those problems. Now, whenever past issues resurface, I just accept that this is my life and do whatever I can to make/keep p022 happy. I feel like I'm no longer my own person and exist only to serve her. To be clear, this is much better than living with my parents, and another person in my position (if they decided to stay with her) wouldn't likely think there's much wrong. It's just the countless little things and my tendency to give up too much of myself which make this hard on me. I've become a shell of a person, and my only consolation is that I seem to upset p022 a little less than I used to.
					</section>
					<section>
						On thing I've noticed that p022 has stopped mentioning some of the things that she would normally get upset about. I don't know if she's decided it's not actually that big of a deal or if my constant attention to her needs has helped offset the things that annoy her or if she's just started hiding her true feelings. This helps decrease my level of anxiety since I'm not constantly being reminded of everything I'm doing wrong or might do wrong, but my paranoia that nearly everything I do is wrong in her eyes remains largely unchanged because I can't peer into her mind and determine her true motivations for her change in behavior (and even if I could peer into her mind, it's not uncommon for even her to not know her motivations for things or how she might respond to certain situations, so it's debatable whether telepathy would even be effective).
					</section>
					<section>
						One thing I think p022 has noticed about me is that I no longer seem to be my own person. Usually multiple times a day, p022 asks me what I want to do or what I want to eat or whatever, but invariably, I try to turn the question back around on her. When she presses me for an answer of my own, I usually end up guessing at what p022 wants (and what I'd be mostly okay with) and use that answer. Many times, she doesn't believe that answer and tries again, but I stick to it. You may be asking yourself why I do this. Well, as I've discovered over the many months I've been with her, every time I tell her what I really want to do or eat or whatever, she shoots it down. Part of the problem is that most of the things I want to do can't really be done with her, and I'm not nearly as choosy with my food as she is, but it's very common that I provide quite a few different options, and she doesn't like any of them. Even when the answers I give her are ones I think she'll like, she still has a high probability of shooting them down. Why should I waste my time telling her my preferences when what she wants is all that matters anyway? Moreover, with every "incorrect" answer, p022 gets a little more annoyed that she still hasn't resolved her question, so if I want to keep her in a good mood, I need to find a "correct" answer as quickly as possible. By the way, I don't consider this lying because I don't consider the things I want to do most to be options, so I chose what I want to do from the options I think I have. Besides that, what I want more than any of the options available is to keep p022 happy, so you could say whichever option accomplishes that is the one I prefer. You can evaluate the validity of that however you like. Anyway, I think p022 can tell that I'm a shell because she's been trying harder to figure out what I want and is seeming less convinced of my answers. I don't plan on changing what I do, though, because I legitimately don't think anything would be different if I made a habit of it, at least not without a bigger conversation about all of this stuff. Even then, I still don't know how she'll take all of this, and I'm not eager to go back to the time when p022 was constantly asking me whether I want move out and/or break up.
					</section>
					<section>
						I think I wanted to say at least one other thing, but it's exhausting talking about this. I wasn't supposed to say as much as I did, but at least I didn't spend an excessive amount of time talking about it (which may or may not be a result of the medicine I'm taking). In other news, I'm crying on my way to work almost every day because, after more than 5 months, I still can't manage to leave for work on time. I think I'm becoming desensitized, though, because I haven't been crying as much as I was a few weeks ago. Also, when somebody asked me how long I had been working at Walmart, it occurred to me that, in a few weeks, I'll have been there for 6 months. In other words, without hardly realizing it, I wasted half a year at a job that brings me no closer to my long-term goals, and it's hard to maintain the fantasy that there's any hope of accomplishing my short-term goals either, considering how I've made essentially no progress on any of them during the entire period of my employment. On the more positive side, though, I have made a rather large impact at work (which looks good on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;), so I suppose the time wasn't <em>entirely</em> wasted, but that can only do so much for me. It's too bad that the largest impact I've made at my new home is filling a few corners with some of my stuff.

						I can't keep trying to live my whole life in a few hours each week. Every day, I wake up, spend most of the day at work, come home, spend a few hours with p022, and then have to stop just about everything because p022 goes to bed, and if I produce any kind of noise or light while trying to do anything, she won't be able to sleep. Everything I want or need to do for myself can only happen when I have a day off and p022 doesn't, and even then, by the time I sleep in and maybe eat, it's almost time for p022 to come home from work, at which time my world will have to revolve around her again. Technically, the revolving around her part starts even before then because she almost always expects some chores to be done before she gets home. I understand how she wants to spend what time she can with me since our schedules allow for only so much of it, and besides the fact that she's bad at coming up with independent activities for herself, she gets alone time just about every day, so it's not surprising that she's ready to spend time with me when I come home; however, I don't get that alone time. Really, I don't even care whether it's <em>alone</em> time; I just need time to do my own things. p022 has told me many times that she would give me time to work on things if I asked, but I know it wouldn't take long for her to start feeling rejected if I actually took her up on that. She already feels rejected at times if I so much as slightly hesitate to agree to spend a long time doing a difficult task for her. And I'm supposed to believe that she would be okay with me asking to have time to do things on my own? I don't have time for anything, though: I don't shower; I don't shave; I don't go to the bathroom; I don't brush my teeth; I don't eat; I don't do laundry; I don't work on important things like my student loans; I don't talk to or spend time with anyone besides p022; and I surely don't do anything fun like grow bacteria or take a computer apart. (All of those things have exceptions, but because of how I have no time to myself, I've given up all of them many many times.) Every day, I feel disgusting, and I worry about what will happen because of everything I'm not able to do. At the same time, though, it's taken so long for p022 to get to a point where I don't have to constantly do damage control that I'm inclined to find a way of dealing with my misery internally rather than confront the significant risk that I'll have to go back to spending every day trying to convince p022 that I don't hate her and don't want to leave her. It's been months since she's questioned whether I want to be with her, and it's been nice not needing to worry about whether she's going to think we should end things when the slightest thing goes wrong. You (and surely she when she eventually reads this) are surely wondering why I want to stay with her if I'm miserable. Well, I don't know how many times you'll end up reading about this, but when I encounter problems, I try to solve them, not run away from them. There were times when p022 and I were really happy together, so it's plainly possible to not be miserable. We've had difficulties in the past but then got through them and ended up much better off. Also, no matter who I'm with, there's going to be at least a few things I prefer were different. If we work at things and work at things but can't seem to keep each other happy very often, then I guess we'll eventually have to see if someone else can, but without having expressed my feelings to give us a chance to work at things, it wouldn't be very fair for me to start looking for a replacement. I just hope, whenever I manage to have a serious conversation with p022, she'll work with me to come up with a solution rather than shut down and leave me to bend over backwards to salvage the relationship. I plainly care about p022 if I've spent such a long time hiding the things I dislike so I wouldn't hurt her and/or push her over the edge, but I can't live like this forever, and if it turns out that I'm the only one ever willing to try to fix our relationship, what chance do we really have together?

					<section>
						As I found out at the end of the day today, it turns out that p022 was upset with me last night because she thinks I called her fat. I know my memory isn't perfect, and sometimes I accidentally say (or don't say) something which causes p022 to think I meant something mean, but I've been racking my brain for what I possibly could've said yesterday that could've been interpreted in that way, and I keep coming up empty-handed. Moreover, I go out of my way to avoid saying anything that could even remotely suggest that she might be overweight at all because I know how strongly she reacts to that, so "calling her fat" as she said I did seems rather out of character for me. Let's say that I did it, though, or more likely, said something that slightly implied that she's fat. Well, it must've been a mess-up in my wording or a joke in poor taste or something because <span class="h3">I don't actually think she's fat</span>. For as long as I can remember p022 worrying about her weight, she's been convinced that I think she's fat. I've told her over and over again that I don't think she's fat, but I don't think she's ever once accepted it. Sure, she's slightly above what would be considered an ideal weight, but no one cares if you're 5-15 pounds above perfect. (I have no idea how much she weighs.) Do I think it would be nice if she had a completely perfect body? Sure. Does p022 think it would be nice if I had more muscles? Yes. (She even told me.) Should anybody waste their time worrying about how they're not quite perfect? No, it's ridiculous. Nobody is perfect in every way, and it's because everyone understands this that they don't really care when somebody doesn't check off every single box for what they look for in the ideal person. However, despite this, p022 still spirals into a pit of self-hatred and convinces herself that other people, in particular me, share her irrationally harsh view of herself. Don't get me wrong: I know what it's like to be overcome with negative thoughts and feel like everyone agrees with those thoughts. The thing that gets me, though, is how she refuses to believe me when I tell her in no uncertain terms that I don't think she's fat.
					</section>
					<section data-revisit="finish">
						As you should know by now, I pride myself on always telling the truth, and although I may try to avoid or sugar-coat the truth at times, I never outright lie. Today, p022 and I dove particularly deep into this I-think-she's-fat nonsense. I looked her straight in the eyes (although she wouldn't look at me) and very deliberately told her basically everything I'm telling you now. I very firmly insisted that I don't think she's fat, but she had already made up her mind that I do.

He made me a little anxious with how he would bolt from one thing to the next and never stand still, but that same tendency made him one of the most productive dispensers. I related to his apparent unjustified difficulties making it to work on time (I never especially noticed him late), and he cared enough about the job and the people in it to bring in his own yellow reflective work vests (I'm not sure if he already owned them) to offset the slowly deteriorating ones we would wear when taking the groceries outside. From time to time, he would give away candy because he and his girlfriend apparently had major sweet teeth. I asked him why he would give away candy so often, especially if he had a major sweet tooth, and he told me how, if he's giving away this much candy, you can just imagine how much he's eating himself. Although other people ask me things about myself on occasion, Joshua probably asked me the most; it would be interesting how he would abruptly ask me a random question out of nowhere because he was trying to "figure me out". He had a military background but I don't know of what variety, and I was quite a way from having him "figured out".

					<section data-revisit="finish">
						<span class="e26">I'm so sick of p022 calling me a liar.</span> This time, p022 was saying how Thomas (the cat) would love her no matter how fat she was, and she rejected my insistence to the contrary. (Notice how it's still about fatness.) How many times do I have to tell p022 that she doesn't have to worry so much about her weight before she'll believe me?
					</section>
					<section>
						Moreover, though, I really hate how, every time p022 upsets me, she gets upset at me. A minute or two after p022 finished calling me a liar, she came next to me and did things which indicated that she wanted me to somewhat jokingly gawk at her appearance. Still being offended about p022 calling me a liar yet again, I didn't give her the response she was looking for, so then she got upset with me. <span class="h2">Maybe I'm alone in this,</span> but it's not very often that I feel inclined to compliment a person almost immediately after they insult me. Something I think is good, though, is how I keep my mouth shut when I'm angry rather than talk and inevitably say a bunch of mean things. Too bad that just makes p022 more angry. If I don't act completely natural and pamper her as much as I normally do, she gets snippy and gives me the cold shoulder. And guess what? The cold shoulder is almost the same thing I'm giving to her. The primary difference is that I'm slightly more talkative, and I don't sprinkle in a bunch of rude things. Why does she get mad at me for responding to an upsetting situation in almost the same way she does? More importantly, though, why does she get mad when I take offense to something mean she said to me? I didn't insult her back; I didn't do things that frustrated her (besides be quiet); I didn't even completely ignore her. I just went about my business in a non-talkative manner and even threw in some brief sentences because I knew I upset her, and I didn't want her to feel totally rejected. The real question is "why do I even want to make her feel better?" I'm sure she'll somehow spin this around on me, but I'm the actual victim in this. Why should I go out of my way to try to make the person who made me feel bad feel good? Why shouldn't I wait for her to try to make things right with me? It's not like I'm the one who insulted her. I'll tell you why: because I'm a nice person, and I know p022 will never initiate a reconciliation. That second one probably played the largest role this time because I'm fed up with getting called a liar, and I was considering waiting for p022 to try to make things right, but our relationship will end before she starts thinking she should be the bigger person. Like I said before, I'm the one who has to hold the relationship together, and that just makes me even more irritated. I shouldn't have to always be the one who's in control of their emotions and who has to fix every problem that arises. I like being able to be that person, but when it becomes a one-sided obligation, it's not hard for me to start developing some resentment towards it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Worse than getting mad at me when she makes me mad, though, is when she gets mad at me when she makes me sad. I know I've mentioned this before, but when p022 expresses her irritation with one of my shortcomings such as being slow or forgetting something important, I get upset at myself, and that causes me to be less inclined to talk and otherwise participate in carefree activities. Considering how I see that kind of behavior in other people all the time and how I frequently see it in p022 as well, I can't help but come to the conclusion that this kind of response if fairly common, so there's nothing especially wrong when I exhibit that same behavior under the same circumstances. However, p022, being the insane person that she is, considers low self-esteem to be cause for further anger. What kind of psychopath gets mad at someone because they're feeling bad?! Am I missing something here? Does retreating into yourself carry with it some kind of significant offense that I'm not aware of? Have I acquired an inaccurate belief that my coping mechanism is reasonably acceptable? I ask these questions somewhat rhetorically, but I've legitimately considered their answers on multiple occasions because I want to figure out what makes p022 respond in the way she does, but I keep coming to the conclusion that I haven't done anything wrong. Being reminded of how I have to deal with this nonsense is another reason why I'm so angry right now.
					</section>

						And yet, despite all of this, I'm still going to try to make things right even though p022 should be the one doing that. I'm going to apologize for upsetting her, and when that's not good enough, I'm going to make an extended effort to pamper her even more than I normally do and do whatever I can think of to make up for the <span class="h0">terrible thing(s)</span> I've done to her.

						At lunch today, I tried starting the process of sucking up to her by asking her how work was going. However, even though I focused on work specifically so our problems earlier wouldn't come up, she was plainly in no mood to reconcile and she told me how her boyfriend ruined her day. Although I tried to hold back some, I responded in a not entirely diplomatic way with how my girlfriend called me a liar yet again but I'm trying to get over it anyway. Of course, p022 didn't like that, and even when I tried to change the subject, she told me how she couldn't talk to me right now. If you want to form your own opinions about the conversation, you can read it <span class="elaborate obvious">here</span>.

								<tr><th>Me:</th><td>Well my girlfriend called me a liar again today even though it's not true at all, and I decided not saying anything was better than saying something mean. However, I decided to try to get over it like I have the other times and try to make my girlfriend feel better even though she's only mad because she didn't like how I reacted while taking offense to her accusation.</td></tr>

								<tr><th>Me:</th><td>Okay.</td></tr>

						When I got home, p022 tried to act mostly civil, but she almost immediately "went to bed" so she wouldn't have to be around me. I put "went to bed" in quotation marks because, although she physically got in bed, she had no intention of actually going to sleep as evidenced by how she watched Netflix in bed for hours (which is something she never would've done alone if she wasn't upset with me). <span class="e-o2">Maybe tomorrow I'll be gifted with the opportunity to make up for my severe offense.</span>

								I just feel awful all the time. I've been crying off and on all day today. I keep thinking of more and more ways why my life is awful. I rarely enjoy my time with p022 anymore. I don't feel like my own person anymore. I keep trying to pretend like everything's okay because I haven't had an actual discussion with p022, but then I never think there's a good time to talk to her, and I'm worried that a single brief conversation abruptly shoved in at some point will do more harm than good. The life has been sucked out of me, and I spend my days as a husk of a person trying to define my whole existence around someone who wants me to be someone I'm not. I hate my life, and I feel like there's no escape. I have to internalize everything because I have no time to talk to anyone. I grow apart from even my closest friends because I never talk to them. I don't acquire any new close friends because I can't invest the time in establishing them. I'm so miserable.

					<section>
						For the most part, as I said in the last entry, the recent events involving p022 haven't affected me too much because I've become so deadened from everything for such a long period of time; however, at times such as right now, I just want to cry. I don't like the uncertainty; I don't like how slow things are to change (if they're changing at all); and I don't like the prospect of giving up on a relationship that's lasted more than a year and a half. I'm running out of time to make things right, and I'm worried a premature decision will be forced upon me because of the rapidly approaching move. I still have very limited time to accomplish anything, and I'm beginning to feel helpless about the whole situation (or maybe that's just a side-effect of feeling like crying). I wanted to finish the relevant journal entries about this subject, but I think I'm just going to have to show p022 what I have and call it good enough because I'm going to run out of time otherwise. I'm worried, though, that p022's going to see all of this and decide that I'm better off without her without giving everything due consideration because she feels guilty about how unhappy I've been for so long. If p022 asks me what I want, I don't even know what to tell her. All I know is that I don't want to be miserable, and I want some stability and direction in my life. I want to be able to live my life and not constantly worry about the future (and present). There's a number of other problems involving p022, my parents, and just life in general, but I barely have time to get into what I've gotten into already. I'm emotionally exhausted, and I still don't feel like there's really anyone I can go to with my problems. I'm increasingly pressured to make difficult decisions, and I don't want to have to keep making decisions. I don't know what's going to become of my life, but I guess I'm going to have to find some way of holding myself together, so I can keep trudging forward and figure it out.

						p018 got engaged today.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although I had originally planned on leaving for my trip today, I ended up putting it off until tomorrow for reasons I'll probably put in a different entry, so I was going about my business trying to finish up the last things I wanted to do at home when I received a picture on Snapchat from p018 at 5:33. The picture was p018's left hand with a plain dark ring on her ring finger and a caption that said something like, "I got engaged!" I expressed excitement and asked her how it happened, but as I suspected, she wasn't prepared to get into it right then, so she told me that she'd tell me tonight. She never actually ended up telling me how it happened, but she surely just forgot in the whirlwind of activity going on today. If I ever get the story, I'll try to put it <span class="elaborate">here</span>.

										So background of yesterday: dans mom came down to visit. My mom came up. All four of us went to Saint Charles octoberfest. After, we ran home to grab a few things (I believe this is where Dan grabbed the ring). We went to his and my favorite park: the sandy creek covered bridge. It was homecoming so a whole bunch of high schoolers were there. We walked around for a bit then we went under the bridge. There, he proposed in the best and hilarious way. He got down on one knee, pretty much told me he loved me so much and then pulled out a ring box. I started crying. It was empty. He said "this means nothing" and stood back up. My face was pure shock. Then he pulled something from his back pocket, got back down on one knee. Opened his hand, there was a coozie. Inside the coozie was my ring and he said "will you do the honor of being my drinking partner for life" and I said yes.

						Although I had no idea p023 was going to propose to her today (as I'm sure p018 didn't), it didn't catch me totally off-guard because, in a conversation I had with p018 on September 20<sup>th</sup>, she had told me that she was expecting it soon because p023 had apparently asked her parents for permission to marry her. I'd imagine p018 has been walking on air all day today.
					</section>
					<section>
						When I first heard about this, I felt the pain I'm all too familiar with trying to wriggle its way to the surface, but I knew how absolutely ecstatic p018 must be, and I really wanted to be happy for her, so I tried extra hard to keep those feelings pushed down, and I was reasonably successful. I talked with p025 about it some (even though she was trying to not talk to me much today so I could prepare for my trip more effectively), but there understandably wasn't much help she could offer to change the determination of my emotions to make me feel bad. There's only so many different ways I can say why I was inclined to feel bad, so I won't bother getting into it again, and I didn't feel it as much today anyway because I wouldn't entertain the negative thoughts. Although I was now preoccupied, I tried continuing the things I was doing before, and although there were a number of things I'd like to talk about today, in the grand scheme of things, nothing else particularly important or relevant happened for the rest of the day.

						That is, until the middle of the night. I was up late trying to get a little more done regarding my trip, and my preparations led me to my room where I was going to get my suitcase to more easily transport the rather extensive number of smallish items I would need to take to my car. However, for some reason, as I stood in the doorway of my closet, my thoughts of p018 gained more traction than they had the rest of the day, and as I thought about them more and more, I actually started processing my feelings. At first, I was just letting myself feel the pain, but as I did so, I couldn't help but notice how it didn't feel only like pain of mostly losing a friend. While still letting myself feel things (as opposed to going into analytical mode), I tried to figure out what else was going on in my head. It took a while, but it eventually occurred to me that I wasn't especially feeling like I had been separated from p018 so much as I was feeling unprepared to let p018 move on in her life. I was thinking about what I wanted from a relationship between us when I finally realized I was thinking about what <em>I</em> wanted. As far as I can tell, p018 would also like us to get closer again, but she has a new life, and however cheated I may feel about the pandemic stealing my chance to say a proper goodbye, her new life doesn't necessarily have me playing the same role. We may have had some great times together, but life moves on, and even the greatest of times must give way to progress. I've been wanting what we had before, but living in the past excludes all of the new things there are to look forward to. p018 has a lot to look forward to, so what right do I have to try to keep her in a world where those things don't exist just because I miss her? Another thing I was forced to consider was what if there was no chance of us ever reconnecting in a way comparable to how things were before? Would I stop considering her my friend? Would I stop caring about her as much as I do now? And that's when I had to face the reality that there isn't anything that would diminish how I feel towards p018. There's something humbling about realizing that you'll care about a person no matter what happens. Although I've never had very strong family ties, even my family usually follows the standard that, while life may take people in different directions, families still find a way to stay together. After everything p018 and I have been through together, we've formed a bond that supersedes any circumstances of the times, and at this point, p018 might as well be a part of my family. I find it interesting how, after we got to know each other pretty well, p018 insisted to both p022 and me that we're stuck with her forever. At the time, I considered that to be a rather optimistic outlook (although I didn't say anything) because a lot can happen in life, and it seemed like my doubts were confirmed when p022 and I started going out and p018 and I slowly lost touch. However, it may be that p018 was actually right all along because I'm finding myself in a position where I could easily let p018 fade into my past as she continues making a new life for herself with p023 and yet I can't help but feel the same way about her as I always have.
					</section>
					<section>
						While I don't have to worry about a girlfriend that might take issue with me saying it, I think I ought to tell you what you probably already know (and which I may have already told you): I love p018. No, I'm not trying to compete with p023, but saying that I "care about" p018 as I have been is an understatement. I care about a whole lot of people, but I only love a select few. p018 is one of them. More than that, although I've been trying to make things happen my way as I've been talking about, it seems abundantly clear now that there are no requirements to the way I feel. That's unconditional love. There's also a saying that I find means more to me now than it has in the past: If you love it, let it go. I may have been an important influence in p018's life in the past, and there may be room for me to be an influence in her life in the future, but things aren't the same anymore, and the past isn't coming back. As much as it pains me to do so, if I truly love p018, I have to free her to live her best life. I've been holding on to her so tightly that I've overlooked the fact that the best thing I can do for her is let her find her own way. I think not wanting to accept this is the true reason why it's pained me so much to hear about p018's new life (at least more recently). I don't want to let her go, but it's not about what I want; it's about how to make p018 happy. I think p018 would be happy to have me in her life, but as long as I hold on to this idyllic expectation of what a relationship between us will look like, I'll never be able to be the type of friend she needs me to be. I've had a very thorough cry about this for the past few hours, and I've had to stop typing a number of times because I couldn't see what I was doing, but it's about time I've come to terms with this. It's really <em>really</em> hard, but this is the closest I've felt to coming to terms with this new p018 in over a year, and if there's been one thing I've been wanting to change more than anything else, it's what kind of relationship p018 and I have now.
					</section>
					<section>
						Because I'm terrible at finishing journal entries, I still haven't finished the entry from February 21, 2020 which talks about all the ways I was hurt by how far apart p018 and I had gotten (although I have notes so I don't forget things), but I was always planning on doing a follow-up entry describing what my current feelings of p018 are. Since I don't think I'm going to get a better opportunity than this, I'm just going to do it now: I don't feel as close to p018 as I'd like to, but I'm seeing now that a big part of the problem is that I haven't made my peace with this new dynamic being here to stay. Ever since I stopped needing to worry about my job using up every waking moment and then p022 feeling dejected if she didn't get the rest, I've been trying to reestablish my friendships across the board, but it's a slow process, and although p018 and I talk now more than we used to, it's still not much. I really miss how things were, but how long am I supposed to hold onto sadness? Apparently it's a long time, but I don't want to keep going on like that. I don't know how I'll feel as soon as tomorrow morning (although it already is tomorrow morning), so I don't know if the feelings I've been having tonight are the beginning of a trend or if there might be recurrences of the pain I've felt before, but I'm relatively optimistic, and regardless, I want to figure this out. Since I can feel the sleep-deprivation decreasing the quality of what I'm typing, let me say the important parts before I end with something lame: p018, I really miss what we had, and I've been hurting a whole lot, but I know things aren't the same anymore, and although I may be late to the party of accepting it, I want to see what we can make of things now. You've been making a good life for yourself, and I want to be a part of that life, but even though it's extremely difficult for me to do, I know I need to let you be the one to decide what role I play. No matter where life takes you, though, I want you to know that I'll always be here for you, and I'll always care deeply for you. You've been a bright spot in my life, but it's about time I stop trying to make myself feel better by trying to mold you into who you were before and instead allow you to grow into an even more amazing woman than you already are. I wish you the best of luck in all things, especially your upcoming marriage to p023, and I hope I can be there to celebrate your new life with you. I love you, p018.

						Although I've taken far too much time getting around to writing about it, p025 and I are no longer together.
					</section>
					<section>
						Way back about 2 months ago <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/26">(or about 3 months ago by the time I finish this entry)</span>, things weren't all that bad, but I kept worrying about what my future held. It seemed that p025 really had gotten in control of her anger, and she was making noticeable attempts to discover and account for the things I wanted to do, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just drifting along in life towards a future I could never feel fulfilled in. I kept trying to identify exactly what it was I wasn't satisfied with and what could be done to fix it, but my answers always ended up being vague and never seemed to satisfactorily explain my feelings. I thought about how I wasn't so sure I'd be able to adequately attend to a wife and kids and still have any time at all for myself with how slow I am at everything, but I still wanted a family like p025 did. I thought about how I didn't want to waste my life away working day in and day out at basically any job, even one in a field that interests me, but I still need money to live, especially if I want to help support a family. I thought about how I needed more time to do the random work I was already doing (mainly DoorDash) because I wasn't making enough money, but p025 had started driving herself, so I had at least as much time to work as she did; I was just too slow actually getting to it, and DoorDash wasn't as good as it used to be in Cape Girardeau (although it was never better than okay). When p025 and I would spend time together, we would usually be watching TV or something equally passive which is fine for a time, but I prefer playing games or learning something or accomplishing something, but not much of what I wanted to do could be done with another person, especially with someone who didn't share many of my interests, and we wouldn't even watch TV too long anyway because, soon enough, it was time to go to bed. I considered the idea that p025 and I just had preferences and ways of thinking that were fundementally incompatible with each other, but that hadn't torn us apart for this long, and p025 had started seeming a lot more at peace with how different I was from her, so if anything, it had gotten easier to be so different from her. I know I felt isolated because I only really ever saw p025 and occasionally her friends or family, but <span class="elaborate">with some caveats</span>, p025 didn't have much of a problem with me visiting anyone; I just had a hard time figuring out how to fit it in between working as much as I could and spending basically any time with her. I also didn't really feel like this apartment which I was partially paying for was actually mine, but that's primarily because it was small, and there were already two other occupants, so there just wasn't any room to put anything I might want without first getting rid of some of what p025 wanted. She was really sad when I told her that it felt like I was just staying at her apartment because she had really wanted it to feel like <em>our</em> apartment. Then there was the problem that I wasn't sure what I was doing with my life: I knew I still wanted to cure aging, but how was I going to get there, and what was I going to do in the meantime? Was I going to go to graduate school and likely be miserable for years and struggle to get my homework done and pass? Was I going to get a biology job and work my way up but then feel like I'm wasting my life away working all the time? Was I going to get a random part-time job for the time being but then especially feel like I was going nowhere in life? Was I going to start my own community biology lab and branch off from there? And with all of these things, how much money am I making (or where is the money coming from)? I'm fine with living on next to nothing, but a family (and p025) wouldn't be. How am I going to fit in time for myself? I already felt like I didn't have any time to do anything, and I wasn't convinced that a reasonably enjoyable job (even researching aging) would offset that, so how was I supposed to handle adding on more commitments? Am I just too ambitious and too slow at doing anything that I'm not equipped to look out for anyone but myself in the long term? I don't want to believe that. None of these things really have anything to do with p025, though. I kept asking myself why I insisted upon worrying about my relationship with her when things had been getting better, but I never had an answer.
						<aside data-heading="Caveats">
							Over the course of our relationship, p025 and I have had some difficulties regarding my friends, mainly stemming from when she found out that they didn't think she was the best person for me when I described some of the ways she would lash out at me, but for a variety of reasons which I might end up saying before this, it had been quite some time since any of my friends had spoken very harshly of her, and more recently, like I said, p025 had done a very good job of getting her anger under control, so there wasn't even anything to speak harshly about. My primary concern was p024 because, although she was the most availible of my friends (although living in St. Louis), she was also the most critical of p025, so I had to be careful. I would also need to make sure that I didn't do anything p025 wasn't comfortable with because <span data-revisit="add a link">that didn't go well last time</span>.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						In the meantime, however, p025 seemed as happy as or happier than when we first started going out. It happened slowly over time, but ever since I had come back from traveling this most recent time, we argued less and less (especially after we had that discussion which somehow completely changed the way she handles her anger); she softened her opinion on a number of things that had been big problems between us in the past such as p1 or my friends or even my traveling; she seemed less embarrassed by me (although I was also making an effort to hide those things); she seemed less annoyed with how I basically never shared her point of view on anything; she smiled more frequently; she was more cuddly despite originally being against that sort of thing; she seemed more energetic; she even took off the necklace reminding her of <span class="person p029">her brother</span> (and hung it above her desk) which she had felt dependent on and which she had never taken off since she got it after her brother died. It seemed like p025 felt like she had reached a pretty good place in her life.
					</section>
					<section>
						Even though things weren't all that bad and p025 seemed rather happy, I knew I had to talk with her about the concerns I was having. I ended up taking quite some time getting around to bringing up the topic because I didn't know what I was supposed to do besides go off on my own and see if I can forge a better future for myself that way, and I hate ruining good times with problems. However, on November 12<sup>th</sup>, I finally managed to bring it up. It was very disorganized and rambling, but I told p025 how I didn't feel like I was living the life I wanted to live, and I wasn't sure what to do about it. p025 told me how she thought we just needed to find our routine, but I was worried that if the routine we found was anything like what it currently was, it would still leave me with a lot of the same feelings I was currently having. She told me how she thought adding more structure to my life and seeing someone to help with my ADD would make it easier for me to fit in more of what I wanted to do and finish things more quickly, but besides the fact that I revile the idea of confining my life to any particular structure, I wasn't convinced that it would make a significant difference, and even if, after months of trying different things with a professional to get my ADD under control, I actually started being able to do things faster, I wasn't so sure that I wanted to spend the rest of my life spending a maximum of a few hours a day on the things I like. (The rest of the time would be working or doing chores or doing stuff p025 wanted or whatever else.) I told her how I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, and I didn't think I wanted kids as quickly as her, and I wasn't sure what kind of income I'd have in my unknown future to support a family. To that, she told me how she thought we had a good thing going with the idea of me becoming a professor on a number of levels (researching what I want, having a relatively flexible and potentially open schedule, getting a good income, ...), and a family was definitely very important to her, but we weren't in a hurry, and we could work out something else if I didn't think that's what I wanted to do or if I thought <span class="elaborate">the process of becoming a professor</span> was more than I could handle, but I shouldn't allow misgivings about my future to project onto our relationship. And yet I was still worried.
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							Since you have to have at least a Master's degree to be a professor at basically any university, I'd definitely have to go to graduate school, and since nearly every professor has a PhD (particularly in science), it would be smart for me to continue past a Master's degree to get a Doctorate degree. Theoretically, the time to obtain a Doctorate degree is as short as 4 years, but within the science field, you're usually pursuing some experiment to completion, and it's more realistic to expect 5 or 6 years, although I've heard stories as bad as 8 or so years. In addition to that, although I'm less clear about what it entails, even after you get your PhD, you generally do a "post-Doc" for some number of years after that which is usually helping someone with research at their university or something. On the bright side, as long as you agree to do extra work in the lab or something, it's pretty common for science majors to have their schooling and basic needs paid for with a stipend. On the down side, I was struggling at the end of my time getting a Bachelor's degree, and graduate school is generally expected to be more rigorous, so I have a legitimate fear of being able to keep up with the workload and passing. (I'm not at all worried about being able to understand the content, though.) Moreover, even if I could power through and get a PhD without failing and then continue proving myself at a post-Doc, the job market for becoming a professor is rather competitive, so there's no telling how long it would take me to find an opening, and there's no telling where that opening would be. (Staying in Missouri and, in particular, near St. Louis is important to p025 both for personal and practical reasons, but restricting myself to Missouri would make it even harder for me to find a job.) So even without employing any pessimism, I'm looking at easily 8 years of misery without any guarantee of becoming a professor afterwards, assuming that the life of a professor is one that I would even decide that I liked in the end.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						Naturally, my arguments weren't leaving many options open to p025, and when she asked me what I wanted to do, I didn't really have an answer. Throughout all of my life, there had only been brief moments when I could fully experiment with what kind of life worked for me: When I was younger, there were my parents that I had to work my life around; when I was in college, I had more freedom, but I still had to fit my life around school; when I was out of college, I was fitting my life around p022; when p022 and I were no longer together, I started making a little progress on figuring out a lifestyle for myself, but traveling isn't particularly representative of what the rest of my life will be like, and it wasn't long before I was fitting my life around p025. I don't know what works for me because I never tried to figure it out without also trying to figure out what works for someone or something else. I don't know if my dissatisfaction with the kind of lives other people live is just me wishing for a fantasy life that reality would force me to put aside or if my very different personality and preferences make it so that a very different life is what would actually fit me. Moreover, I have some general idea of things I like and things I don't like, but I don't know what I'd actually like or dislike when taking the real world into account, so I don't even have a particular goal I'm striving towards. All I know of a fully independent life away from other influences is living in my car, and although there are some improvements that could be made, I wasn't all that upset with it, and it satisfied more of my needs than were currently being satisfied. It may be that, in order to attain some of my bigger goals (especially a family), this dull, work-filled life that I see in my future with p025 is an unavoidable concession I need to make, but having never pursued anything else, I can't know whether something better is out there. It also may be that having the stuff like a family would provide enough value that I wouldn't care about making concessions to have that, but having never had it before, I can't say for sure, and from my current perspective, I'm not convinced of that being the case, at least not enough if I wasn't reasonably satisfied otherwise.

							It's at this point that I switch over from typing this entry anew to transcribing what I recorded myself saying as I tried to talk through what I wanted to put in this entry. I was struggling quite a bit to force myself to continue with this entry because it takes me forever to write things, I knew addressing this would make me feel bad, and I'm quite adept at finding things to distract myself with. I knew that I could stay focused on conversations when I have them in-person (and for the most part virtually, but that doesn't apply here), so I figured it would be worth a shot seeing if I could talk through what I wanted to say and then get it transcribed. Much to my relief, after a rocky start, I got on a roll and got through all of the notes I had on this. My recorder actually ended up not saving anything past the 3-hour mark (<span class="e26">although it still indicated that it was recording</span>), so I had to rerecord the last part, and I ended up spending almost a solid 6 hours altogether talking about p025 in the middle of the night. Although there are probably reasonably effective paid transcription services out there (and maybe ones you need an account for), I didn't have much luck finding a free one which would make it unnecessary for me to type my own transcription, but I suppose it worked out reasonably well because I didn't necessarily say things in a clear way the first time around, and I could make the text much closer to journal-ready as I typed. It also didn't defeat the purpose of talking through it in the first place because it's many times easier for me to copy things than it is to think of what to say.
						</section>
						<section>
							Although I revised everything to make sure it flowed reasonably well, I didn't spend too much time cleaning up what I said to be on the same level as what I normally type because it's just too much, and I need to move on. For a reasonably large amount of time at the beginning of transcription, I say things that are similar to what I've already said, but I thought it was different enough to keep. You should also watch out for me frequently switching between the past and present tense and having long run-on sentences (longer than usual).
						</section>
						<section>
							Considering how everything after this point was typed in only a little more than the amount of time of everything prior to this <span class="elaborate obvious">more accurate analysis</span>,
							<aside data-heading="Analysis">
								I resolved to start this entry on January 1<sup>st</sup>, but for the first few days, I was getting around to and finishing making a way to store people's names in a place where they wouldn't be saved in the version history of this website but where they could still be accessed to replace the numerical references I actually type. I ended up getting distracted with more programming after (and to an extent, during) that, but I finally started typing this on January 6<sup>th</sup>. (I moved the date ahead a little because that's when I made a more substantial contribution.) I spent every day after that trying to focus on typing more, but I frequently had a hard time focusing on the entry, and it wasn't uncommon that I would find something else to work on because this entry is so imposing and depressing. Even when I was doing well, it would take many hours to type each paragraph. (No surprise there.) Late on January 15<sup>th</sup>, I got fed up with how little progress I was making, so I decided to try a different tactic and talk though everything. Transcribing myself was grueling, and it often felt like it was never going to end, but I finally finished on January 22<sup>nd</sup>. I wanted to clean up what I transcribed and add more because you know how much I like rambling, and that took longer than I wanted it to, but I was getting really close to finishing when I had to put it aside to participate in the all-consuming Bio Summit. (I was quite upset that I wasn't able to get it finished beforehand.) There's a very good chance I would've finished everything on January 27<sup>th</sup>, but with Bio Summit wedging itself in there, it's now January 31<sup>st</sup> that I'm finishing this.
							</aside>
							I'd say that transcribing an entry I talked through first is a massive success, and I definitely plan on doing this for entries in the future, especially long ones. (I'm still trying to figure out how small of an entry is too small to benefit from doing things this way.) It's basically a guarantee that, if you're reading this journal in order, you'll have already encountered an entry I transcribed, but this is the first time I actually did it. Using a count of spaces as a proxy for word count, there are about 10&times; more words after transcribing as before (and you have well over 25,000 words to read before finishing this entry). If you read this entry 2.6 times, it'll be like you read the first Harry Potter book. It's insane. I was dissatisfied, though, with how much emotion was lost in transcription. I considered including the recordings of me talking in order to better demonstrate the emotion I was feeling, especially since they're 3&times; shorter when you remove the silences, but then it occurred to me that I used p025's real name (and a lot of other people's real names), so I had to abandon that idea.
						</section>
						<section>
							As you read this, it may seem like I'm detached at times, but I assure you, unless I say I'm feeling detached, it's very likely that what I'm saying has a large effect on me. Because of how things worked out, I had to listen to the recordings of myself go through this multiple times, and it was brutal. Even when I finally finished listening to everything I said (which seemed like would never happen), as I added a few things I missed and rearranged stuff and whatever, I could hear my sad, pathetic voice recounting what happened and crying, and it's been awful.

					<section>
						Even during the course of this conversation, I hardly knew what was going on because it was just a whole bunch of me saying, "I don't know what I want" and p025 saying, "Well, this seems like a good way to go. We can figure it out." But then I'm just dissatisfied. She says all this stuff, and it's not bad, but I don't know: I'm just not on board with it. I feel like there's something more, but I don't know what it is, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that. We've worked out a lot of our problems, and she's seeing a future: Okay, we go from an apartment and get better jobs and move into maybe a small house or a bigger apartment or something and then we do that... She has this plan of what she wants to do to move forward, and it's not a bad plan; it's not something that I'm against, but it's like I'm seeing my whole future laid out for me, and I'm not sure that that's the future I want. It seems similar to one that's pretty much what I want, but I don't know. I have all of these worries about all of these little things, and I don't know if I'm just blowing them out of proportion or if that's just life or if maybe there's something to it; maybe we should be doing something differently. But then I think to myself, "Why am I worrying about this stuff now when things have been getting better? Shouldn't I just wait longer since things seem to get better over time?"
					</section>
					<section>
						I remember telling p025 before we were even going out that I'm scared of my life being normal. She would tell me about her goals such as how she just wanted to have a family, a nice house, work at a school, and take care of the kids; that's what she wants for her life. And although I got over it, I remember, at the beginning (as has happened to me a few other times when people have told me about the normal lives they want to live, including p05 to some degree), I get fairly anxious as if this person's normal life is going to rub off on me, and then I'm going to be normal, and I'm not going to live up to what I want to be. Consequentially, when people are telling me how they just want to be normal and do this normal stuff, it makes me anxious because that's not what I want. Nothing's really changed with p025: She still wants to be normal; she still wants to do normal stuff; and that's fine: People can be normal. But I don't want to be normal, but some amount of normalcy is required in order to conduct yourself in life, but I feel like it's not as much as people would have you believe.
					</section>
					<section>
						And so she's telling me these plans for the future that are reasonable and aren't bad and, to some degree, are what I want to do, but it's just normal stuff. It's just, you work a lot, and then you come home, relax for a short time, and then start over; it's center your life around your family; it's do things the way people are expected to. And it's not a bad life, but I'm not sure it's the life I want for me, and I don't know what that means because I want a family, and I want <span class="elaborate">a house</span>,
						<aside data-heading="Thoughts">
							I've thought about exactly what type of house I'd like and how big and whatever. That can change a lot.
						</aside>
						but I don't know how that works in with me not wanting a normal life because some of those things still have to work like that because that's how it is, but I don't know. I don't know. That's what I said a lot to p025: I start rambling about random stuff, and then I just say, "I don't know" a whole lot of times because I don't know how to make sense of what I'm feeling. I've always had a pretty clear idea of what things I wanted and how I'm going to get there. Not a clear plan with everything laid out, but I would have some idea of what I was doing. And I've always been good at describing my feelings and knowing why I feel certain ways and the like, but I was just worried that the future I saw in store for p025 and me wasn't one that I would feel fulfilled in. And I don't know how to find out what I want without doing my own thing. But then, at the same time, I don't want to lose p025: We worked so hard on so many things; we came so far; she wants a lot of the same things I want; she really cares about me... And what? When I'm just not sure what I'm wanting from life, I just throw that away? And then what happens if I go try to figure out what I want from life and then I figure out the stuff I was wanting was actually kind-of unrealistic, and the things p025 wants are more in-line with what I need, and so now I just threw away a good thing because, for a time, I wasn't sure what I wanted out of life.
					</section>
					<section>
						Although it was, once again, quite disorganized and rambling and even I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on, in large part what it came down to was that I don't know what I want, but p025 does, and it may turn out that what I want is what p025 wants, but I'm not sure at this time, and p025 is ready to lock into our relationship and plan the rest of our lives together, but I don't know what I'm doing, and doesn't she deserve to have the security of having someone that, for sure, wants to plan their life together as well? It's not like this is at the beginning of the relationship where everyone's still trying to figure everything out; we'd been together for over a year, and I'm still here not knowing what's going on?
					</section>
					<section>
						p025 said how she knew what she wanted from her future, but if I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a part of that future, I should go and figure it out and not stay with her where I wasn't sure I wanted to be. I may not be sure what I want to do with my life, but one thing I am sure of is that I don't want to hurt p025 and that I want to be there for her when she needs me, so it's not like I was a fan of the idea of leaving her either. (That's in addition to the whole question of what happens if I later decide that I do want the same things she wants.) She has some amount of self-respect, though, and she knows that she can't just keep hanging onto someone who isn't sure their future's with them. She was telling me how Thanksgiving was coming up and we had been together over a year, and soon enough, everyone's going to start wondering when we're getting married. p025's family was already joking about that earlier, but I know it's not going to be a joke too much longer because those people get married fast and young (and then get divorced, but that's a whole other issue). But how long can I keep saying that I'm not sure whether marriage is in our future? I also think it's important to mention here that this isn't the typical uncertainty about the future: When I was with p022, I wasn't sure whether we would get married in the future, but I wasn't constantly questioning whether I felt invested in the relationship. p025 was waiting to see if something happened to take us off the road to marriage whereas I was waiting to see if something happened to put us on the road to marriage.
					</section>
					<section>
						In the midst of all of this, both me and p025 are upset, although p025 was kind-of shutting down her emotions, surely in an effort to keep herself from hurting. She was trying to be logical and emotionless and not heartless but to-the-point. In the meantime, I'm quite upset. I keep going back and forth in my mind thinking maybe I want to be with her, and maybe the future she wants is the same as mine, but maybe not; I'm not sure. Then the thought that keeps coming back into my mind is that she deserves someone who's more committed to her; she deserves someone who isn't thinking that their future <em>might</em> align with hers but who <em>knows</em> that their future aligns; someone who doesn't have second thoughts all the time. Doesn't she deserve someone who's all-in with her and not considering other options? I was still keeping things in my car and trying to not commit to certain jobs because I wasn't sure what my future held, and I didn't want to having everything riding on the fact that I was with p025 only to discover that things weren't working out and then have a really hard time coming back from that because I had closed the doors to my other options. I was leaving doors open just in case because I wasn't sure what the future held. That's not the type of person who is fully committed to someone and who says that this is my future; our futures are together; and we're going to work it out through anything. p025 didn't need to change too much for me &mdash; in large part, I fit into her life rather than the other way around &mdash; but she definitely was completely committed. She wasn't saving anything just in case. She was going to work through anything no matter what, and that's part of what made her such a good girlfriend, but then doesn't she deserve that in return?
					</section>
					<section>
						Eventually, she told me how, if I wasn't sure that this is what I want, then I should go and figure out what I want, and she would start getting my stuff together. I didn't want her to just throw my stuff into a huge pile and mess it up, so I went to help, but I wasn't eager to go along with what she was saying; it's just that she was already doing it, so I felt like I needed to help make sure everything went smoothly and make sure nothing was left behind. As we packed up my stuff, p025 said repeatedly how this was my choice: I could stay there and commit to a life with us together, and we'll work through whatever comes up or I could leave, but I shouldn't stick around if that wasn't what I wanted. I'd tell her how I didn't know what I wanted and how maybe it was what I wanted, but I didn't know, but obviously, that's not good enough. She kept saying over and over again how me leaving was my choice and how, if I wanted to stay, I could stay, and if I wanted to leave, I could leave. I didn't want to leave, though. I didn't want to hurt her. I didn't want to throw away everything we had. But she kept reminding me that I shouldn't stay there if that wasn't what I wanted. But I don't know what I want. This kept happening throughout the time I was getting my stuff packed up. p025 told me how I wasn't going to be allowed to come back in to get anything I left behind, so I had better make sure I get everything in one trip. That seemed unnecessarily strict, but I knew she didn't want to drag anything out any longer than she needed to. On a side note, while I was packing up, I could swear p025 was deleting pictures of me from her phone; I didn't see the screen, but it looked like those were the motions she was doing.
					</section>
					<section>
						Most of my stuff was squeezed into p025's bedroom, but there were a few other things stashed away in random places, and at one point while I was getting some of the stuff stashed away in random places, when I came back, I saw on the pile of my stuff a plush stuffed cow which I recognized: Some number of months ago (it had been quite some time), I had bought p025 that cow after she had made it very clear that she thought it was really cute and that she wanted it. She would refer to it as her "moo moo cow" which is kind-of a childish term, but I always thought it was cute. Ever since she got her "moo moo cow", she would cuddle with it all the time; having it would make her so happy; she'd sleep with it at night; she'd smush her face into it all the time like she would do with all cute, soft things. That cow had given her so much joy and comfort for so long that, when I saw it on my stuff, it really got to me. p025 saw me get extra upset at seeing it there, and she told me how she didn't want anything to remind her of me. She said to take it, throw it away, whatever, she didn't want it. I would've thought that the cow was enough of her thing that she wouldn't feel bad about keeping it; I didn't really think of it as a symbol of our love; it was just a stuffed animal. I wouldn't have thought that she needed to get rid of it, but maybe part of the reason it gave her so much joy and comfort was because it reminded her of me, and maybe that's why she had to get rid of it. I didn't want to take that away from her, though. I didn't want to take away something that had given her so much happiness, but then again, isn't that what I'm doing by leaving? I took it and didn't throw it away because, first off, I just don't like throwing away people's stuff in general, but then also, it was still a pretty nice stuffed animal. She also gave me other random things that I gave her or that she made to remind herself of me or whatever. She forgot a few things, but I didn't mention it because I was hoping she might keep them; maybe she forgot something there was from me or something, and then she could continue being happy with it. I'm not particularly optimistic about that, but you never know.
					</section>
					<section>
						After this very prolonged process of me not wanting to leave but still not knowing what I'm doing and p025 saying that it was my choice but I needed to know that I wanted to be with her, I finally got all of my stuff. I gave her a few things of hers that I still had such a key to her apartment. I stood at the open apartment door not wanting to go. The cat started looking out the door, and I was worried about it getting out, but then p025 picked it up and said to it how apparently it really was only her cat afterall (as opposed to the cat we got together). And that was it. I took my stuff to the car, crying. I only did the most basic organization to get the stuff out of the way, and I drove to a different parking lot, so I wouldn't be parked right next to p025's apartment. p025 sent me a text saying I could give her a call if I decided my plans aligned with hers, and I told her I'd definitely keep that in mind. I sat there and cried.
					</section>
					<section>
						I ended up being able to talk to p018 on the phone, and I tried to tell her the stuff that happened. I had a hard time telling her what was going on because it was so awkward and vague and all-over-the-place. I didn't even know what my own thoughts were. I had a hard time saying what happened and why. p018 started off keeping options open for how I might be able to salvage the relationship and what my next steps might be, but as the conversation progressed, she started switching over to just comforting. Eventually, p018 had to go. She made it seem like she had gotten me calmed down enough that it was okay for her to leave, but I knew she just needed do to other things, and since we had talked some and I wasn't totally freaking out, she figured there wasn't going to be a better time to make her exit. (She may dispute this interpretation of events, but this is my journal, so you hear what I think.) I let her go. She told me to let her know if I needed anything. <span class="elaborate obvious">Messages after hanging up</span>

						The parking lot I was at was a Goodwill parking lot because I wanted to donate p025's moo moo cow rather than just throw it away. At least then, someone else could love it. I didn't go in right away. I sat and I looked at the cow, and I thought about how much it meant to p025 and how much it would hurt her with it being gone. It made me wonder what she was going to cuddle at night. I guess there's the cat. As I was trying to prepare myself to go into Goodwill, I of course had to calm myself down enough so I wouldn't be crying as I went in there; that would be awkward. But before I took the cow in, I wanted to have one last moment with it. I smushed my face into it like p025 would do all the time; I gave it one last bit of love; one final goodbye. I let myself cry, and then I composed myself enough that I thought I could be seen in public, and I walked in and looked for an employee. I found one (and it seemed like there was only one), and I told them that I was donating the cow. They took it kind-of awkwardly; I'm not sure how the donation process normally works, but I feel like that wasn't it. Maybe they were just caught off-guard or something, though. After using their bathroom, I went back to my car and prepared for my departure.

						I knew I couldn't stay in Cape Girardeau because there aren't enough places to park if I'm not able to park at p025's apartment, and I can't make enough money there, anyway. Naturally, my parents' house was wide open, but I couldn't handle going back there right after breaking up with p025: I knew that anything my parents would say about the situation would only make it worse, and it was bad enough as it was; I didn't need it to be made worse. Also, if I went home right after breaking up with p025, it would make it seem like I couldn't take care of myself and like the only reason I was away from my parents was because I had a girl taking care of me or something. I wanted to make sure it was known that I'm my own person, and I can take care of myself. I probably could've forgotten about that last part, though, if I thought my parents would make me feel better during a hard time for me.

					<section>
						Despite how hard everything was on me, though, I was hardly even thinking about myself. The primary things I kept worrying about were things like who's going to help p025 take care of <span class="p0">her dog</span>? Who's going to feed the fish? Who's going to help her with her science homework? Who's going to be there for her when she's having a hard time with something? Who's going to cuddle her while she's watching TV? Who's going to play Wii games with her? Also, it may have seemed like p025 was detaching herself from her emotions while all of this was going on, but I knew that wouldn't last, and I knew how much she cared about me, and I didn't want to put her through the pain of me leaving her. I just want her to be okay. I want her to be happy. I wish I could be there for her but she had always made it very clear (after we were already together) that she didn't want anything to do with an ex-boyfriend, so it's not like I could break up with her and still be her friend; I had to break up with her and leave her to fend for herself; leave her to cry with no one to comfort her; leave her in a place where she's expressed saddness that she's no longer around the people she's closest to; leave her to abruptly have to do everything for herself. And I hated it. I hated doing that to her. I can try to say how maybe it would be better in the end all I want, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't still tear me up inside to hurt her so much. Something I didn't think about for a long time is how p025 has said many times in the past how, any time she finally started getting close to people and opening up to them, they would leave her. I can't help but think that p025 would likely consider this to be yet another instance of someone leaving her after she gets close to them. I don't want to leave her, though, and I especially don't want to leave her with heartache, but that's all I can do at this point.

						Anyway, I didn't go home right away. That night, I ended up going to a rest stop. I figured I could later go into St. Louis or around there and try to make some money. I had only been barely scraping by on money for a long time, so I could really use some extra to give me peace of mind. I wasn't too quick to make some money, though, because I was feeling miserable, but I didn't take too long, either. After a few days (I'm pretty sure), I worked a few days at one place, and after that, I had a decent enough cushion of money that I didn't really do anything for a while.
					</section>
					<section>
						I tried to think about what I would do now that I was no longer with p025, but I didn't really know because I don't really know what I want to do with my life. On the one hand, it made a whole lot of sense to go back to traveling because I no longer needed to be worried about making p025 upset (about that). At the same time, though, was I just going to travel forever? Was I never going to accomplish anything; just live in the moment and never establish myself anywhere and just keep moving around? Is that really what I want? I wouldn't have to travel forever, but is that even what I want to do right now? I didn't really know. I was thinking to myself, though, how it would be so ridiculous to travel the whole time I was with p025 and make it so hard on her but then stop traveling when I was no longer with her. That seemed really dumb. I thought to myself, "Well, I don't have to keep traveling and keep traveling. How about I do one more nice, long trip: do what I want, not be rushed like I have been in the past, and then be done?" I had been thinking earlier about how cool it would be to go to New Orleans and watch their New Year ball drop (which apparently isn't actually a ball). The new year was far enough in the future that that seemed feasible. I was also thinking about how I wanted to go to Boston for the <a href="https://www.biosummit.org/">Bio Summit</a> biology conference where people from community labs got together and shared information and stuff. I was thinking that starting my own community biology lab was pretty much the only thing I was kind-of on board with pursuing, so maybe I could forge a future for myself with that. There was still some amount of time for me to make enough money for me to afford traveling and make it there in time. I knew Bio Summit was in late January, so if I also wanted to go to New Orleans for the new year, I'd still have enough time to make it there as long as I didn't have to work too much (based on my previous rates of travel). I had a month or so before Christmas, at which time I'd want to visit my parents, and after which time, I'd need to leave for New Orleans. With the time until Christmas to make money, I could probably build up enough to make the trip. I figured that plan was as good as any, so I might as well work towards that.

						I wasn't doing too much work at the beginning because I was busy sitting around doing nothing. I played a lot of videogames on my Nintendo Switch (especially <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>). It wasn't an active or conscious coping method, but while I was playing videogames, I wasn't thinking about p025, so I feel like that was part of the reason I started playing them a lot during that time; that, and I also get addicted to videogames. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/26">I'm also more convinced that it's a coping method now because I had a sudden increase in desire to play videogames as I was transcribing this.</span> I would play the radio in the car because that's what I like doing when no one's around; I like listening to music. I pretty much knew it already, but it became especially apparent how basically every single song in existence is related to love in some way: searching for it, being in it, losing it, making it, ... Easily 90% of songs have something to do with love. More recently, I've started paying more attention to the lyrics of songs, especially since p025 apparently hears the words of every single song always and can't imagine how somebody couldn't hear and pay attention to the lyrics. So I would hear the words of the songs more than I would in the past, and it didn't help at all; it made things worse because then it's <em>really</em> obvious what the song was about. I also couldn't help but remember how some of the songs I had heard for the first time while p025 was scrolling through TikTok and also how some of the songs were sung by p025's celebrity crush, <span class="p0">Harry Styles</span>. Those things didn't affect me as much as I expected them to, but they definitely didn't help either. During this time, I also discovered at least part of why people like listening to sad songs when they're sad: If it's sufficiently like the problem they're experiencing and they're listening to the lyrics, it can help them focus their emotions and be guided through them. I've also heard the reason that they give the person a reason to cry or that they just don't know, but those reasons never seemed sufficient to explain why sad people would want to listen to songs that make them more sad. I still tend to avoid sad songs while I'm sad because it makes still makes me more sad, but I feel like I understand it more now, and maybe part of the reason I avoid sad songs when I'm sad is because I'm a guy and feel like I'm not allowed to be sad.

						I had started putting together some stuff for and in my journal because I knew I wanted to talk about the breakup, but I didn't have much success on getting started. I didn't really have a solid reason for why that was, but part of it was because I would get distracted, part of it was that I was too busy hurting to type things or something <span class="elaborate obvious">side note</span>, I don't know.
						<aside data-heading="Side note">
							This is actually pretty much what happened with p05: My journal was essentially up-to-date until p05 and I broke up, and in between the flood of emotions I was having and quickly accumulating a lot I wanted to talk about, I quickly fell behind, and being in notebooks at the time, I couldn't skip to current events and fill in other things afterwards because I couldn't be sure I'd leave enough room (and it doesn't feel right to not talk about something that important). There wasn't as stark of a parallel when p022 and I broke up because it was a slower process and there wasn't a heartwrenching end, so I didn't feel as compelled to write something, and it was easier to continue letting everything fall behind.
						</aside>
						But I started putting together an outline of what I wanted to say, and as I was doing that, I was thinking to myself how there was no way I was processing what was going on: I felt bad but not awful; I was kind-of detached. I would let myself get distracted. I didn't really want to think about what had happened because it hurt. As I was putting together notes for this entry, though, it became clear that I wasn't processing my emotions or what happened to me because just listing the things would start making me feel bad, but then I would just play videogames or something because I had gotten the notes down, so there was no more need for me to continue focusing on this. I knew I wasn't truly taking in what was going on. It's partially because of that that I felt like I needed to keep hurting. I hadn't hurt enough; I hadn't processed what was going on; I hadn't gone through my emotions and figured out everything, so I have to keep hurting to keep it alive; I have to keep hurting because I can't just forgive myself so easily for what I did to p025. So that was a big motivator behind why I wanted to write this entry: I wanted to feel like I had gone through everthing, like I had addressed everything I was feeling, like I had given p025 the attention she deserves, like I had given our relationship the attention it deserves. I haven't really typed up much of anything that has gone on between p025 and me because I haven't really had time. You could argue that I could've done something about the time or that I did have time, especially during traveling, ... I don't know. Things take forever. It's taken me so long to type this even though I've put off everything... I don't know. I'm not going to argue with you. This is the way it worked out.

						I kept worrying how p025 was doing because I don't care about myself. Who cares about me? p025 is the one who matters here. She's the one whose pain I care about. She's the one who's surely especially hurt by this. She's the one who felt more invested into the relationship. In my efforts to make sure that p025 was okay, I told <span class="person p027">her best friend</span> about a problem she had when she got divorced from <span class="person p028">her ex-husband</span> which she had told me only her sister knew about because they had been living together at the time. I knew p025 and her friend had planned on talking later on the day of our breakup, and I figured they would talk anyway about something so important regardless, so sometime later in the day on the next day when I figured enough time had passed for them to get around to talking, I texted her best friend <span class="elaborate obvious">text</span> and told her about the problem, asking her to look out for her and make sure it didn't happen again.
						<aside data-heading="Text to p027" data-date="2022/11/13">
							When p025 got divorced from p028, she started [doing stuff]. Apparently, only her sister knows because they were living together at the time.

						On November 14<sup>th</sup> (2 days after breaking up), I was surprised by a call from p025 in which she asked me for some help with her science homework. (I think it involved making a graph.) She told me that she didn't know who else to ask, but I told her that it was okay that she contacted me, and I proceeded to help her. Once we had gotten through the problem, p025 didn't really want to hang up, and she ended up asking me what my plans were. I told her my plans to the extent that I had them. p025 mentioned how she knew I had talked to <span class="person p027">her friend</span>, but she didn't seem upset. She told me how I had trained her well with traveling so much because, now that I actually am gone, it just feels like I'm on another trip. I told her how that wasn't my intent. She said that one of the hardest parts is not knowing whether she should wait for me.
					</section>
					<section>
						A few times, p025 had said stuff along the lines of that I could call her if I decided my plans aligned with hers, and as she made the offer, I got the impression that she was expecting me to figure out what I wanted in life within a few days or a week or two, but I knew that wasn't anywhere near the amount of time it would take.
					</section>

						So when p025's telling me how she's not sure whether she should wait for me, I said how I was wanting to keep that option open for myself, but I didn't think that she should wait for me, and I didn't particularly expect us to get back together. p025 was obviously upset by this, but at the same time, I'm sure even she knew that it's better for her to know that she shouldn't be waiting for me. She told me how she guessed she would get a science tutor to help her from now on, so she wouldn't have to bother me. Before she hung up, she told me how she still loved me, and I told her that I still loved her, too (and that was 100% true both then and now). Regardless of whether it would be smart for us to try to live the rest of our lives together, I still love her, and I don't expect that to ever change. I still care about p05 and p022. Just because we're not together anymore doesn't mean that I stop caring about them. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/25">As I review this entry, I've been questioning the value of citing so many conversations (as you'll see more of), but I already have a conversation ready to go about talking to p025, so you can read it <span class="elaborate">here</span> if you'd like.</span>

										I got a call from p025 just now because she wanted help with her homework. After I did that, she seemed to want to talk more and asked me what my plans were. She also asked me why I texted <span class="person p027">her friend</span>, although she didn't seem upset about it. She went on to describe what she was feeling in a small way and ask me things like how long I need to figure out what I want. I told her how I'm not sure how long I'd need, but it would probably be a while, and I likely couldn't commit to her as much as she would need me to if I came back now. Also, being called isn't a bother, and I definitely don't want to be completely rid of her, but there never seemed to be a middle ground between staying with her forever and removing her completely from my life. Surprisingly, she said she might think about being friends if she can ever stop reliving everything every time she talked to me. She said one of the worst parts is wondering whether she should keep waiting for me, and I told her that I want to keep the possibility open for myself, but I don't particularly expect it to happen. She told me she'd get a science tutor, so she wouldn't have to bother me again, and she also said that she still loves me. I told her that I still love her too.

I can go into detail about what various things I think may have been contributing to my feelings over time, but the bottom line is that I've been waiting around to see if I'll acquire a strong desire to be with her for the rest of my life whereas p025 has been waiting around to see if anything will sour her existing strong desire to be with me for the rest of her life. I think a person should give something like that time to see if it works out, but it's been a while, and although that's not necessarily cause to take drastic action on its own, with how indecisive I am on everything else, I feel like I owe it to her to be completely committed before trying to restart our lives together. Maybe I'll later decide that she's the perfect person for me and I messed up a good thing, but I know I'm not feeling it enough right now.

						Later, I talked to <span class="person p026">a mutual friend of ours</span> who we knew from Walmart (p026). I didn't tell her anything about what was going on, but I told her that p025 needed a friend but that it was a secret (since I didn't want it to get back to p025 that I was the one who prompted her to reach out). It turned out, though, that p025 had already talked to p026 and arranged a time to meet. I said how that was good, but then p026 asked me for clarification about exactly what happened because p025 was vague, and she didn't want to upset her by asking for details. I said stuff, but it's not worth my time and energy to describe the conversation to you. You can <span class="elaborate">read the whole conversation yourself</span> if you're interested.

I had no expectation of her contacting me ever again, so I was quite surprised when p025 called me, and I was even more so surprised when she gave the slightest hint that we might be able to be friends in the future if she can get over everything.

						When p025 and p026 got together, p026 posted a picture of them together on her Snapchat story which I saw. On the one hand, they seemed happy, and it was good that they were together, but on the other hand, I saw that p025 had put back on the necklace to remind her of her brother. In my mind, that was a clear indication that she felt abandoned by someone who meant a lot to her, so she needed to find comfort by latching onto whatever she had of someone else. At least he won't leave her any more than he already has.
					</section>
					<section>
						I also talked to p024. I waited a little while because she had always told me how I should break up with p025, and it felt insensitive to talk to her too quickly. Before I told her anything, I told her to not celebrate what I was about to tell her, and she pretty much knew what I was going to say from that, but she agreed. She told me how she was sorry for what I was going through, but she thought it was for the best. I, on the other hand, have no idea what's for the best, but this is my life now. <span class="elaborate obvious">Full conversation</span>

						Relating to still caring about past girlfriends, with no longer having p025 to worry about and having previous girlfriends on my mind, the feelings I had been suppressing started emerging from the recesses of my mind, and it became more apparent to me that I was upset about how p022 decided to just ghost me one day. After everything we'd been through and how we were actually trying to stay friends after breaking up, I feel like I was entitled to at least an explanation. I had been suppressing my thoughts of p022 so much because they upset p025 so much, and so when p022 decided to sever all ties with me, it hurt, but I shoved it down because caring about it too much would hurt my current relationship. Now, however, those feelings have been allowed to surface again, and I don't think what she did was okay: If continuing to talk to me is painful or if she felt like she couldn't move on while continuing to have me in her life or if some other circumstances made her feel like she shouldn't be talking to me, it's sad, and I feel like there are other solutions, but she should've at least told me. I shouldn't have to find out that she doesn't want to talk to me anymore by not receiving a response from her forever and then later discovering that she secretly unfriended me on everything. I feel like I was entitled to at least a notice, but I didn't even get that. And you know what? It hurts not being in p022's life as well.
					</section>
					<section>
						Now I have to face things like how I have a bunch of p025's stuff, and I don't know what I should do with it. Worse yet, I still have p022's stuff. A large percentage of all of that stuff is stashed away in my room at my parents' house which is arguably a big part of why especially p022's stuff still persists, but I still have a sizeable number of items from my old girlfriends, and I feel like that's not how it should be. At the same time, though, it would really hurt me to get rid of that stuff. In my car right now, I have a keychain round-bottomed flask made out of ironed perler beads that p025 gave me because I'm a science guy. She also made one for herself, possibly because she thought it looked cool (I feel like this is the less likely option), possibly to remind herself of me, but I have both now. I just hate the idea of throwing anything away, though. I'm probably going to try to find a way to give away as much as I can. I could probably give away the keychains and just not say where they came from, and then some other science nerd could enjoy them. I think I'm going to leave the one keychain hanging from my car vent for the duration of my current trip, though, because I don't want to forget about p025 so soon. Some items, however, are rather personal / specific to me, and I couldn't possibly give them away, so I guess I'm just going to have to throw them away. Most of it is at my parents' house, though, so it's not like I'm doing anything with it any time soon. I'd need to get myself mentally prepared before I got rid of anything, anyway. I have more than physical items as well: I have pictures, person-specific notes, apps I wouldn't have otherwise, ... I deleted pictures of p022 from the favorites folder on my phone because p025 was throwing a fit, although it did make sense, but I still have pictures of her elsewhere on my phone. (Since breaking up, though, I've added back to my favorites folder a few that I especially liked.) I told p025 (and it's true) that it's hard and quite time-consuming to track down and delete every single picture of p022. At the same time, though, I enjoyed some of those moments. I have pictures of p022 in with the <span class="t0">Biology Club</span>, but I don't want to rid myself of memories of the Biology Club just because p022 was in it. Some pictures of p022 were from before we were even together, just having fun times, and I like being reminded of fun times. I have pictures of p025 where we were having fun times, and I like having fun times. Other people would say without hesitation that I need to get rid of all pictures of past girlfriends, but I'm not other people, and I don't care what other people do (to an extent). This is my life, and I want to make decisions that are good for me, and also, potentially, for future girlfriends. It's that last part that's really hard, though. I think about how p1 still has a few pictures of his old girlfriends. P2 seems somewhat annoyed but gets over it, but I would always think to myself how insensitive it is for him to have pictures of his old girlfriends. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span>
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							Although the pictures alone would likely be enough for me to consider the situation insensitive, the feeling is especially evoked because, rather than just having a general reminiscence of a time in his youth, p1 typically also adds in accounts of things like exactly how desirable certain parts of their bodies were.
						</aside>
						Isn't that what I'm trying to do, though? I talk about wanting to save pictures of good times, but then they would still be around for other girlfriends, and isn't that insensitive? What if p022 and I had stayed friends? Would that suddenly make it okay for me to save some of the less intimate pictures? I like to think to myself that I keep some pictures to document things for my journal, but if I'm changing p025's name and not adding any pictures of her so she can't be identified, what excuse am I supposed to use to keep any pictures now? Do I really need that picture of her catching a fish when we went fishing? Do I really need that picture of her doing crazy stuff with her dog? Do I really need that picture of her living it up on the dancefloor of her cousin's wedding? (You'll notice how I didn't even mention intimate couple moments.) I filmed the first kiss we had together, but if I'm not going to show her, I can't put it in my journal to document an important moment in my life, and why else would I have something like that? (And I'm sure there's plenty of you wondering why I would want to document that in the first place.) Basically all of these things apply to pictures of p022 as well. I'm more confident that I should get rid of the posed pictures that were meant to provide me with a pretty picture of her, but what about the rest? Also, is it okay to just never look at the pictures and have them stashed away somewhere or do I have to seek them out and get rid of them (which could take many hours)? Then I keep coming back to thinking about how I can't just think about what I want: I have to think about what my imaginary future girlfriend would want. So now I can't just do what works for me; I have to do what works for someone else, but I'm already having a hard enough time figuring out what to do just for me. Aside from the pictures, I still have other things from p022 and p025 like notes describing things like what they like or what I'm planning on doing for them or what I want to remember to say about them in my journal. A few of the notes (even like the first two examples) could be useful references for writing about them in my journal or they could be useful for planning things in my future (such as the brainstorming I did for potentially proposing to p022), but where is the threshold for how useful something needs to be in order to keep around? There are some notes I should probably get rid of, but I don't know: Part of it's just that I'm lazy; part of it is that I feel like, if I finally resolve these things, &mdash; if I get rid of the stuff, the pictures, the notes, whatever else I'm done with &mdash; then I would be totally done with them, and they'd no longer be a part of my life. It's like going through breaking up again, except this time, I'm actively eliminating them from my life against my own wishes. I had a bunch of apps on my phone that were only for p025. I kept them around a while, but more recently, I got rid of them along with a few other apps I wasn't using. It was hard. <span class="elaborate obvious">What kind of apps were they?</span>
						<aside data-heading="Apps description">
							They were things like TikTok or Trivia Crack 2 or some party game apps which I had only used to play some games with her and her friends. There was also a couples app that I was supposed to use with p025, but even she had deleted that a long time ago.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						I'm also really lonely. I was already feeling isolated with p025 because I would only ever see her friends or family occasionally, and the rest of the time, it would be all her, and I would never interact with any of my friends. Now, I don't even have p025; I only have a few residual friendships with people I haven't seen in a very very long time, and now I'm in my car trying to recover from losing someone important to me, but I still can't go see anyone because I still need to try to work and build up my money. And even if I did get to meet someone &mdash; I did end up getting to meet p024 since her schedule is much more open than someone such as p018's &mdash; one day isn't enough to offset months and months of isolation. I haven't seem my friends basically ever while I've been with p025 both because I had been around her so much but then also because, when I was traveling for instance, I didn't want to stop to see other people because it would lengthen the amount of time I'd be gone, and p025 would get upset that I was seeing other people but not her, and I didn't want to upset her. I hadn't seen much of anybody the whole time I was with p025, and then before that, I was with my parents for a short time not seeing anyone, and then before that, I was with p022 only seeing her and stuff. I would see the people at Walmart, but that's not the same thing. So for quite some time, I haven't really been seeing much of anyone. And now, after breaking up with p025 and being left with hard feelings from that, I don't even have a single person to be around. The loneliness was really getting to me. It also made it worse that it seemed like it wasn't going to be immediately over as I had been hoping it would be.
					</section>
					<section>
						In between all of these other things I had been thinking about (and playing games and not thinking about anything), I was thinking to myself, "How am I supposed to have a relationship ever?" Things between p025 and me were getting better. We had some kind of future that seemed reasonable; she was totally committed to me; everything was fine, but I still didn't feel right. Am I just destined to never be with anyone? Do I just do a good job of convincing myself that I care about other people, but then when it comes down to it, it's all about me? And if I really do need a really different life, how am I ever going to find anyone to share it with? How am I going to have a family like that? If I can be with someone who's pretty similar to me like p022 and it doesn't work and I can be with someone who's not very similar at all but we're together anyway and eventually things are going pretty well and she's totally committed and everything and that doesn't work, what does work? What am I supposed to do? Maybe I end up liking someone in the future; who's to say that that's not just going to fall apart as well? How am I supposed to have any kind of relationship if I'm dissatisfied with the entire array of options I have? I know for sure that I definitely don't want to have a relationship right now because I don't know what I'm doing with my life, and no matter who I would be with, the relationship would just turn into another p025 situation, and it's not fair to put other people through that, and I'd rather not go through it myself, either. <span class="elaborate obvious">Side note</span>
						<aside data-heading="Side note">
							As I was packing up my stuff to leave p025, she told me how she didn't think a (new) girlfriend would help me figure out what to do with my life. I told her how that wasn't my intent, but then she cited the small amount of time between her and p022. To that, I cited the many years between p022 and p05.
						</aside>
						However, is there ever going to be a moment when I suddenly decide that I do know what to do with my life? Is there ever going to be a time when I know that I want certain things out of life, and I'm certain that's never going to change, so I can start looking for people who want that as well? (Also, who's to say that the person I would be with would also never change their mmind.) Or am I always not going to be sure whether I have what I want? Am I going to have these big plans of things that I think I want, but then I can't attain them very readily, so I always feel like there's something more that I'm missing? Maybe I decide I want certain things, and there's someone who provides those things, but then I want more later. I'm not one to accomplish my goals and then just be content with my victory: I accomplish my goals, and I think it's great, and it makes me happy, and I'm proud of myself, but then I want more. I want to take my goals even farther; I want to set my sights on something even higher; I want to accomplish things in different areas that haven't had as much progress. I value what I've done, and it's not like I always feel like there's more left to be done before I can be happy, but if I stagnate and quit aspiring to take on the next obstacle, I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I know most people have similar feelings in this regard (although they may disagree based on how I describe it), but I feel these things on a much smaller time scale, and it plays a much more prominent role in my life. What happens when my original dreams are okay with my significant other, but when I accomplish those dreams and look to move onto bigger and better things, my new dreams don't sit well with that person? Am I going to build a life with that person only to have it fall apart when I want to take on new challenges? How am I supposed to keep everything from falling apart? Is the only way of doing that by giving up on doing more with my life? Giving up on always having another mountain to climb? Is that something I'd be okay giving up? It doesn't especially feel like it.

					<section>
						I feel like I'm an alien who was raised by humans and taught the way humans think and act, but when I try to relate to other people, I can't muster up the same feelings as them because those things don't come naturally to my alien brain. It's not uncommon that I feel like I'm talking to people in the way they want me to talk to them and responding to people in the way they want me to respond to them, but when I check whether my thoughts match my behavior, it turns out I'm just putting on a show. That's not to say that I secretly hate everyone as many people theorize, but when someone is having a hard time with something, I may feel bad for them simply because they're sad, not because I think their sadness is justified; when someone is excited about something, I may be happy for them simply because they're happy, not because I think their excitement is justified; likewise for most other emotions. Even when I do feel the same way as someone else in a given situation, it may not be for the same reason. I can manage to find common ground with people, and I think I do a pretty good job of understanding people, but when it comes to core principles, I find that I don't have much company. I found a way of getting along with p025 and p024 rather well, but that doesn't mean I'm anything like either of them or agree with them on much of anything. I definitely am human, and at another time (especially while I was younger and people were more inclined to come up with crazy theories about me), I may be trying to convince you that I'm just like everyone else, but more often than not, I find that I see the world through a different lens. How many people are you going to find who put fondness of friends on the same scale as fondness of girlfriends and only makes a distinction between the two based on how much they want that person's life to influence theirs? How many people are you going to find who run their lives so methodically that, when they wonder whether they're showing a preference towards talking to girls (which most people wouldn't even care about), they set up a whole study on themselves and proceed to collect data to try to find an answer? How many people are you going to find who don't think of any member of their family any differently than they would of a random person who they knew just as well and who they felt like they should visit on holidays? That's not even to mention the vast array of preferences and opinions I have which may not be exceptionally strange but which definitely contribute to making me quite unique. There are times when I feel like I'm the only member of my species.

						As I think about what I want in a significant other, I generally end up coming to the conclusion that I want something like a live-in best friend: We see each other a lot because we live in the same place, so we can frequently enjoy each other's company, but at the end of the day, we lead separate lives; we pursue our own interests; if we feel like going somewhere on a whim, we do it without worrying about the other person missing us; if we decide we don't want to do something with the other person, no one gets offended; if something keeps one of us up late, the other person doesn't get upset that they have to go to sleep alone. Throw in <span class="elaborate">some cuddling</span>, and I'm basically good to go.
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							No, I didn't mistake cuddling for a different activity. I may feel differently in time, particularly because I know I've made mention in the past of wanting to share more intimate activities, but even at times like those, stuff like cuddling composes the majority of what I'd like to partake in.
						</aside>
						I suppose it's possible that I just haven't "found the right person", but I really don't think I have it in me to live my life for another person. I can't get everything I need out of life from a single person, and I alone can't provide everything another person needs from their life. It doesn't help that I'm so different from everyone else that our life needs are likely to align less than they would for the average person. I could find someone who was my female clone, and we'd get along great and relate to each other more than we could with anyone else, but if I couldn't spend a reasonably large amount of time with other people and be able to do my own independent activities, it's very easy for me to see that relationship losing favor with me. Although some people do, I'm not going to become a different person just because I'm in a relationship, and I feel like a relationship should provide more of what I need without taking other things away. Does the type of relationship I want even exist, though?

					<section>
						I've also started to become fearful of judgement from my past self. From all up until this time, I may have changed to some degree, but I've always felt that younger me would understand or approve or would do so if the situation was explained, but I'm not so sure anymore. I had plans of taking my education as far as it would allow, so I could be the best prepared to take on a cure to aging, and yet here I am, quite possibly not pursuing any more than a bachelor's degree, living in my car with no prospects of scientific advancement, and wondering how much of myself is worth sacrificing to accomplish great things.
					</section>
					<section>
						I feel like there was more than just that, but the other main thing I'm thinking of my younger self not being okay with is how I had always wanted to wait until marriage, but then I didn't with p025, and now we're not even together anymore, so it's not like I would've only ever been with my wife. And what does that mean for my future, now? Am I just never going to wait now because there's no point anymore? The first time is gone, so now I should just be with whoever whenever? (It would still be with someone I cared about, though.) Moreover, if I tried to wait with anyone, that would seem really insensitive because I didn't wait with p025, but now, suddenly, this person isn't important enough to not wait with? If someone expressed a desire that <em>they</em> wanted to wait, I'd have no problem doing that, but that desire is quite rare, and if I solely relied on what the other person wanted, I wouldn't have even ended up waiting with p022. I've always felt quite uncomfortable about the entire topic, and although I wouldn't say that I had a strong disdain of people who didn't wait, I definitely thought they could've benefitted from being more virtuous, and I always wanted better for myself. Unlike other things, I know that what I've learned growing up doesn't justify the change. Many of you may find it silly to be concerned with it, but I very much don't like the idea of becoming someone I wouldn't have thought as highly of when I was younger. More than that, I'm not sure what I think of people like that now. I've spent so much of my life being conditioned to look down upon things like that and to avoid the subject in general that it makes me painfully uncomfortable any time I have to figure out how I feel about it, and in the end, I never actually figure out how I feel about it because all I can feel is what has been drilled into me. In all likelihood, if my past self could see how torn up my current self is over feeling like I'm letting my younger self down, I'd probably forgive myself out of pity, but acceptance out of pity is a pretty hollow victory, and I don't know how to reconcile everything I've done over time.
					</section>
					<section class="t0">
						Although I was tempted to just make no mention of it, I've also experienced a worsening attitude towards my addiction. While I was with p025, I increasingly turned a blind eye towards it because it wasn't much compared to what we were doing, it was held at bay for long periods of time, and there were times when it could be said that it was for p025, but with us no longer being together, it's once again become a disgusting activity that demonstrates my lack of self-control. My younger self would also definitely be upset that this problem still persists after so many years (not to mention how he would be appalled that it became a problem in the first place). I hate talking about this so much. I think I said the main points; I'm moving on.
					</section>
					<section>
						Then, while I'm feeling bad about all of this stuff, I start feeling bad about random stuff that's not even related to p025 or p022 or anything. I'm already feeling bad, so let's just add on more things to make me feel bad for no reason. For example, maybe I feel like I let my friends down for one reason or another or maybe I'm upset at myself for not flossing more or maybe I feel like I'm just a disappointment in general. It doesn't make any sense, but I can't help myself.
					</section>
					<section>
						In my despair, I think to myself how I don't have the energy to suppress my problem traits. I don't have the energy to try to force myself to not be so slow; I don't have the energy to try to rephrase my thought processes so they don't seem so outlandish and potentially unfavorable by others; I don't have the energy to make a girl feel as important as she might want or to pretend like I'm missing someone when I'm not (although I'm missing plenty of people right now) or to delete pictures I liked but which a girlfriend didn't like me keeping or to feign interest in something that isn't very interesting at all. Although some of the things could be viewed as me just being different, some of the stuff is a legitimate problem, even for me, and other stuff is just plain insensitive. So even if I found someone who could accept or even like how different I am from everyone else, if I can't control the things that mess up my life and theirs, how's that going to work out? Also, let's just say that this exhaustion is only temporary because I'm feeling bad (which is entirely possible); is the only way of having a good relationship with someone by putting up these kinds of pretenses? Will it always be necessary for me to mold myself into a polite and typical human in order to not offend people?

						When Thanksgiving came around, I went to go stay with my parents. I didn't tell them right away what happened between p025 and me because it was still hard on me, and I didn't want to deal with the fallout of me telling them. I was surprised they didn't ask me tons of questions and make it come out sooner. They've been prying into my life less and less as I've gotten older (or perhaps just as they've gotten older). After a few days, though, I figured they really should be told about it. I didn't end up telling my parents at the same time. P2 was asking about when they might see p025, and as I kept rejecting her suggestions, the truth came out. She was a little disappointed, and she felt sorry for me. Later, with p1, he was going on a long rant about what I should be looking for in a girlfriend and how I definitely shouldn't be committing to p025. After that went on for a little while, I told him how I guessed it was good that p025 and I were no longer together. He paused for a moment because he wasn't expecting that, and he briefly mentioned how he was sorry. I told him how he's only kind-of sorry because I'm upset, not because we're not together anymore. He didn't really have much to say on that subject, and then he went back to ranting. Being p1, that was far from the only day he lectured me about my life and girls. I don't like it normally, but already not being in a great disposition, it was affecting me more than usual. <span class="elaborate obvious">Conversation about that and stuff</span> I tried to ignore him like I usually do because he tells me ridiculous stuff and also tells me to run my life in a way I don't want to, and I was especially motivated to tune him out because he was plowing right through a sensitive topic without regard for how much it hurt me. As is often the case, however, I may try to say a sentence or two (if I can get them in without getting cut off), and at one point when I was with my parents in the car and he was going at it again, I told him very directly how he doesn't know how things actually were between me and p025 and how I don't want to lead the life he wants me to lead and how I don't appreciate the stuff he keeps saying because I actually care about what happened to my relationship. Naturally, that made absolutely no difference to p1, but later that day when there was a lull, p2 came over to me and gave me a hug and told me how it's not always as easy to remember that guys can have a hard time during breakups as well. Once enough time since Thanksgiving had passed, I pried myself away from my parents to do work in the St. Louis area since I needed money, and I knew I wouldn't be as successful at working if I stayed with my parents.

						After some time had passed, I was still feeling bad in between feeling nothing, but I had also built up a little bit of money. Then, on November 29<sup>th</sup>, I got a message from p025, much to my surprise again. She apparently needed some money for whatever reason, and I still owed her $<span data-currency="USD">400</span>. I had a little bit to spare, so I was able to give her the amount she asked for. I told her to not expect to be able to ask for more any time soon. She wasn't quite finished talking to me, though. She said how she wasn't sure whether she wanted to know how I was doing (since I had been too okay without her in the past). I told her how I wasn't sure what she would think of exactly everything going on, but I still think about her a lot, and it oftentimes makes me sad. She said that she does that too but that she was okay. I told her that was good because I wanted her to be okay. She told me that she misses me, and I told her that I miss her too. <span class="elaborate obvious">Whole conversation</span>

						Although that conversation was hard because it brought my emotions to the surface again, it actually made me feel better on some level because I was really worried about her being devastated. It was so easy for me to picture her being so heartbroken from what I did to her and having it have such a negative effect on her because things in the past with other people have had a similar effect on her, and I've seen her have a hard time when things weren't that good between us. When she told me she was okay, though (relatively speaking), it made me think, maybe she's able to find a way forward; maybe she's sad but not devastated; maybe I don't have to worry quite so much about her being able to move past this.

						In the meantime, I was doing okay with money for living. I had a decent amount; it was alright. But I was thinking about how much I would need to travel to New Orleans and to Boston. I was thinking about how there was a time limit there: New Orleans by New Year's, Boston by the end of January. So I needed to have money by a certain time, and Christmas was coming up; I would need to have it before then. I was looking at how much time I had left, and it was possible, although I would need to work just about the whole time. That wasn't something I was very fond of because I wouldn't be able to visit people if I had to work the whole time, and like I said, I was really lonely and going through a hard time, and I thought I might finally be able to see some people, but it seemed like that was being taken away from me. On top of that, though, my car started having some problems: For no apparent reason, my car would randomly turn itself off, luckily usually only very soon after starting my car, so I wouldn't have gone anywhere yet. Naturally, I didn't like that. That's a big problem. I figured it had something to do with the battery and possibly the corrosion on the battery leads. I had to delay the one meeting I had set up with p024 because my car was breaking down, and I would be the one driving us. I got some battery cleaner and cleared out all of the stuff in the back seat of my car in a Walmart parking lot in order to access the battery underneath. I used a wire brush and the cleaner quite thoroughly, and in the process, I also found a slightly loose wire connection which may have been factoring into the problem. Once I got all of that taken care of, my car seemed to be working again. However, not long after that, the service engine soon light came on. Having a trouble code reader, I was able to see what the error was, and it corresponded to a problem that <span class="elaborate">a mechanic mentioned</span> a long time ago.
						<aside data-heading="Recollection">
							Just before I went to Arches National Park before I went to California, I went to a mechanic to get my car's oxygen sensor replaced since I wasn't equipped to do it myself. Before they did anything, they ran a diagnostic like they always do, and they told me there were actually two things wrong with my car. I found that strange because I had never seen a second error code on my code reader, and although the people seemed trustworthy enough, I know anyone can <em>seem</em> trustworthy, and mechanics are notorious for claiming that more things need to be repaired than is actually the case. I might've just gotten it repaired anyway if it wasn't much, but it was a sizeable amount more than the repair I knew I needed, so I decided to wait to see if it became more of a problem and to see if I could fix it myself. (After finally going back to see that the price of the oxygen sensor replacement was $<span data-currency="USD">214.89</span>, I know that the other repair cost at least something like $<span data-currency="USD">400</span>, if not $<span data-currency="USD">600</span>.) The error code I saw when the service engine soon light came on more recently was the same one they said was a problem then. I don't know if it just took a really long time for it to become more of a problem or if it was just coincidence.
						</aside>
						When they had told me the price it would be to fix the problem, it was fairly expensive. So now I'm thinking to myself, I need a certain amount of money to live; I need a certain amount of money to drive my car to New Orleans and Boston (due to time constraints, I wouldn't have much opportunity to work along the way, so I'd need to have close to enough money to make it there, at least); and now, one top of that, I need a fairly expensive car repair? I'd also like to have at least some amount of buffer money because I had been worrying an increasing amount about something happening to my car and then not having enough money to fix it and then not being able to make more money because I need my car to make more money (at this time) and then my whole world comes crashing down around me. Then, taking all of that into account, I have only a certain amount of time in which I can make all of the money I need if I still want to go to the places I was planning on going to. To make matters worse, I was having an unusually difficult time finding suitible jobs with <span class="elaborate">my most effective way of making money</span>.
						<aside data-heading="Description">
							It's an app (JobStack) that allows me to find temporary jobs in the area and work a full day there. Although DoorDash is better in the city than it is in Cape Girardeau on many levels, it's also harder for me to get the best value out of it because I don't have to do anything at any particular time, so it's harder to force myself to start doing it, and it's easier for me to stop doing it to eat or get distracted on my phone or just be slow (and then it's hard to start back up again). With the JobStack app, I sign up for a specific time to work, and I have to be there at the start time and keep at it all the way until they're done with me (excluding lunches). DoorDash can be competitive, even taking gas into account, but I just can't be productive enough with it.
						</aside>
						So I was looking at all of this money I needed to make, more money than I thought I would need in the first place, and then I was getting short on time, and my best source of income wasn't cooperating, and I was getting very worried about being able to make the amount of money I needed in time. If I couldn't get enough money in time, the primary thing that would happen is that I wouldn't be able to travel anywhere which isn't the end of the world in ordinary circumstances, but I had come up with the traveling idea as a last-ditch attempt to provide some tiny amount of direction in my life since I didn't know what else to do, so if I wasn't able to do that, I'd <em>really</em> have no idea of what I was doing in my life. I felt lost and directionless even with the traveling plan, but without it, I'd have absolutely no idea what to do with myself at all. Needless to say, this was a very stressful time for me, and I did't know how I was going to get through it.
					</section>
					<section>
						Not too long after that, though, the stars aligned, and my most effective way of making money produced a job offering at Walmart. The offering was originally only for 3 days, but being Walmart, I suspected there was a good chance of me being able to get days added and potentially work up to Christmas. In the event that I could work for Walmart for all of those days, I'd be able to have enough money for everything I needed as well as a little bit extra. Better yet, soon after that, the service engine soon light randomly went out. I definitely still wanted to have enough money for a potential repair since the light randomly went out rather than went out from me fixing something, but not having the light glaring at me was a welcome change. With a job in hand and a service engine soon light not lit, things were looking up for me.
					</section>
					<section>
						I did end up working for Walmart, and I was also able to get the time extended until Christmas. After I was sure I'd be able to get my time extended, I went to stay with my parents because the Walmart wasn't actually all that far away from their house. I figured I might as well take advantage of the bigger space, predictable parking, and free food, and also, by staying with them, they wouldn't feel as cheated out of my company as they would if I had only visited for a few days around Christmas. So I stayed with my parents and drove to Walmart for about 3 weeks. I was stocking at Walmart, and they primarily stuck me with stocking refrigerated things since <span class="elaborate">that's what I did on the first day.</span>
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							On my first day of working at that Walmart, I wasn't sure where I should go because they're never clear about that, so I ended up following <span class="p0">someone</span> who looked like they had a working arrangement like mine. It turns out that my suspicions about them were correct, and they were indeed a temporary worker for Walmart, and that person was stocking refrigerated items that day. Since I had come in with them, I also went to stock refrigerated items. Although I resisted it and worked in a different area on a few different days, they did like I knew they would and stuck me in the refrigerated section for pretty much the entire time I worked there because I got refrigerated stocking experience on the first day, and they prefer people sticking with what they know, so they trapped me in the cold. At least I felt valuable because they really did need good help in the refrigerated section of Walmart.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						While working, I was hit with an overwheming sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Here I was working at Walmart like I did not so long ago, stocking (which I did very frequently at Walmart), and fighting back tears from hard times in my life, and also trying to immerse myself in work in an effort to prevent myself from feeling things and crying in a public place. It seemed like my life had gone full-circle. At least I was better able to suppress feelings of my future going nowhere because this was only a temporary job (although I still felt very much clueless about what I wanted to do with my life).
					</section>
					<section>
						On a side note: I wouldn't say that I started having particularly strong or frequent thoughts on the matter, but I started contemplating thoughts of other girls, and I wasn't sure how I felt about it. When you're in a relationship, you're not thinking about a future with some other girl, and if you think some other girl is pretty or something, you try to forget about it because your girlfriend is supposed to be the prettiest girl around. However, I was no longer in a relationship, so such thoughts aren't forbidden. I still felt like it was too soon since being with p025, though, and I'm not ready for that, anyway. It occurred to me that it had been quite some time since I was even allowed to have such thoughts. I had been with p025 for over a year, and in the short time before p025, I was still recovering from p022, and then before that, I was with p022 for over a year and a half, so it had been about 3 years since I had the option to indulge thoughts of other girls. I don't plan on hopping right into enjoying my bachelor life, but it's strange to think that I could.
					</section>
					<section>
						After I finished working at Walmart, we did Christmas stuff which wasn't much because I guess my family is getting old and not wanting to do much. Soon after Christmas, I managed to squeeze in a meeting with p11. Soon after that, much to the disapproval of my parents, I needed to leave for my trip. I keep glossing over how much my parents disapproved of everything even though it was a really big deal every time, but they hardly ever approve of anything I do, and I have better things to talk about than how my parents, once again, didn't want me doing something, and I, once again, used logic and sheer force-of-will to defy them. (Granted, defiance isn't a given when I disagree with my parents, but that's how it goes when it is.)

						I didn't go too far at the very beginning of my trip because there was some stuff I wanted to do in Cape Girardeau. Some of that stuff was meeting up with p020 and p030. In addition to that, though, I had forgotten this credit-card-like thing in my wallet that is supposed to be used for pet vaccinations, and I needed to drop that off with p025. However, I figured while I was doing that, I might as well throw in some extra things, so I went to Petco and got an antler for her dog, a cat teaser / laser pointer for her cat, a fancy feeder for her hamster, and <span class="elaborate">bacteria balls</span> for her fish.
						<aside data-heading="What are these?">
							They're transparent spheres which are supposed to release beneficial strains of bacteria into the fish water in order to break down waste, clarify the water, and remove harmful chemicals that can build up. p025 and I had bought a package of these once before.
						</aside>
						I figured, if the stuff was consumable or useful and for her pets, she would be less likely to want to get rid of it. Just in case, though, I kept the receipt and put it in the bag, so if she decided she didn't want the stuff, she could return it rather than throw away perfectly nice things and also waste my money. I put the credit card thing into the bag with the pet stuff, and I also added an extra Papa John's coupon card I had which she has used in the past to get free pizza for when her friends come over. I took the bag and dropped it off at her door and then returned to my car. After that, I sent her some more of the money I owe her, and in the optional message sent with that money, I told to look outside her door. I assume she got the stuff. I also mentioned in the optional message that <span class="elaborate">she should spend the money on a Cricut</span> for her birthday the next day. She didn't respond to anything, but I didn't really expect her to, and I was fine with just getting her the stuff. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/31">Also, it's been over a month, and I haven't seen a refund credited to my account.</span>
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							From my understanding, a <a href="https://cricut.com/">Cricut</a> is a brand name for a thing that cuts up paper-thin stuff into shapes and letters that you can use to customize things. p025 had mentioned wanting one for a long time, particularly for making custom T-shirts. p025 had prompted me to get her one for Christmas, and she was very much looking forward to getting it. The amount of money I gave her ($<span data-currency="USD">200</span>) would've been enough to buy the machine.

						After that, I left Cape Girardeau and started my travels for real. I stopped by Memphis, Tennessee and did stuff there; I went to Jackson, Mississippi and didn't do much there. There's a decent chance I'll say a little bit more about those places in a different entry. Along the way, I was adding pictures to my Snapchat story. I hadn't put pictures on my Snapchat story for quite some time because I didn't want to upset p025 by posting reminders that I wasn't with her, but now that that no longer mattered, posting pictures there was an easy way of sharing pictures with my friends. Something I found interesting was that, in the list of people who viewed my pictures, I could see that p025 was looking at my pictures. I don't know if she was looking at the pictures and getting upset that I was doing something as seemingly fun and extravagant as traveling or if she was sad and missed me and wanted to see what was going on with me or if she was mostly okay and was just curious to see what I was doing; I don't know. But I found it interesting, and it kind-of made me a little happy because, to me, it seemed like she was demonstrating that she still cared about me.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, I kept traveling south, and I eventually made it to New Orleans on New Year's Eve with plenty of time to spare. I had time to find a place to park in the madhouse and wander around and see what there was to see. I can talk more about what I saw in my adventures later, but I want to focus on p025, here. Something interesting relating to p025 on New Year's Eve was that, in the midst of me walking around and looking at stuff, I got a message from p025 on Snapchat. I didn't open it right away because I thought it would be awkward to open it so quickly, but soon enough, I did open it only to find that p025 had deleted the message. There's only so much information you can extract from a deleted message, but as I tried to figure out what could've lead to this happening, my leading theory was that p025 had seen my pictures of being in her favorite city of New Orleans, and especially since I had recently given her nice things, she was feeling sentimental and wanted to say something on an important day but then had second thoughts and decided to delete it. I was originally letting her be because I didn't want to make her have to go through any more pain by talking to me, but if my theory was true, it may have been that she was just scared to say something to me, so I decided, when the time came, I'd send her a simple "Happy New Year", and regardless of whether she responded or not, at least she would know that she doesn't have to be so afraid of me. I did a few more things after that, and when the new year came, I watched the fleur-de-lis (&#9884;) drop and fireworks and all that good stuff, and when stuff calmed down some, I wished some people a happy New Year, and I wished p025 a happy New Year as well. Soon after I wished p025 a happy New Year, she asked me why I was messaging her. I gave her a brief explanation, but it turns out that my theory was very much misguided: It turns out that what actually happened was that she was playing Truth or Dare (probably) with her friends at a New Year's Eve party, and she got dared to message me, but then, since she didn't actually want to contact me, she deleted it. I apologized for misinterpreting the situation, and I tried to quickly bring the conversation to a close, and for a time, it seemed like I had been successful. However, after some time had gone by since p025 had read my last message, she popped back into the conversation to tell me how she had just finished sleeping with someone. Now, throughout all of this, I was trying to not take things to heart because I wanted to enjoy the day, and I knew I messed up with messaging p025 and bringing all of those hard feelings to the surface, especially when she's surely drunk. In contrast to the previous two times we spoke, p025 was taking a much more hostile stance, but I knew that could just be her way of coping with this unexpected interaction before she had time to process her emotions. So I was trying to not take it to heart, and I was telling myself that I'd allow myself to feel everything more thoroughly the next day. However, when p025 went out of her way to hurt me by telling me how she had just slept with someone, I was still fighting it, but she really got me. I know from stories she's told me about her past that she uses sleeping with people as a coping mechanism, and aside from that, I knew she would keep herself satisfied between relationships &ndash; the person she slept with is almost certainly the person she's slept with before in between relationships &ndash; but I figured she would wait longer or, upon reflection of these events, I figured she would wait until she was healed rather than use that as a way to heal. I know she doesn't take that activity as seriously as I do, and I tried to use that, along with the fact that she uses it to cope, as a way to help mitigate my instinctual reaction to what she told me, but I think of that type of thing as something to be only shared with someone you care deeply about, so it still hurt to hear about how easily she would give it to someone else, and it hurt more so because of how she tried to use it as a weapon against me. I consider this conversation to be particularly important and/or to have the most additional information contained within the actual words, so I'll make this conversation obvious to see rather than hidden away like other conversations:

									Okay, I pretty much knew it at the time, but that does sound a little dragged out and insincere.

								Because you're probably at least somewhat drunk, and it's basically a guarantee that all of this has been thrown on you without you having time to process your emotions.

								I think, regardless of what you try to tell yourself, you're still hurting from the end of our relationship, and in an effort to mitigate that hurt, you either try to pretend it doesn't exist, distract yourself, or lash out. By mistakenly starting a conversation with you after your quite tasteless dare, I brought those feelings to the surface, so you needed to make an extra effort to cope. Although it's possible it would've happened anyway, especially with you getting drunk, I think you slept with whoever it was because it served the dual purpose of getting your body to release chemicals to make you feel good, and by telling me about it, you could hurt me. I know you and your friends (and many other people) tend to think of intimate relations as a kind of measure of status, but that's not how I view it, so no amount of guys you get into bed will change how successful I think you are in life. However, you should know that I think of intimate relations as something very special to be only shared with someone you really care about, so by alerting me to the ease with which you gave away something only we shared not long ago, you were rather successful at hurting me. At the same time, though, I try to balance the instinctual hurt with the knowledge that you don't take the act as seriously as I do, and you've even told me yourself that you use the activity to make yourself feel better, and who am I to judge the ways you cope? I think about your divorce from p028 and how the pain from that drove you to [do stuff] and jump from guy to guy, and I worry about our breakup sending you down that same path, especially since you were so quick to tell me how you loved me more than him, but I hope you're able to take a healthier path this time. I also think about the difficulties we faced regarding your tendency to express anger when you're upset, and I worry that, in an effort to combat your feelings towards me, you'll return to using anger as a shield and potentially end up scaring away the person that would be best suited for you. However, your treatment of me provides little indication of whether that fear is justified. As for myself, it may seem like I'm forgetting about you and moving on with my life, but that's no more true than that people who post happy pictures on social media are happy all the time. As time has gone by, the pain has lessened, but as I said earlier, I'll never completely heal because I'll always care about you. I'm sure that sounds rather hollow to you because I'm the source of the pain, but that's my position regardless. I've actually been feeling quite lost in my life, and I worry about what the future has in store for me, but doing nothing would guarantee that I have no future, so I do what I can in the present and hope that I come up with a better plan later. There's a part of me that's looking for validation of the things I've said here, and I'm sure you're ready to tell me how wrong and egotistical I am, but I think it's for the best that we don't pick apart the details of what I've said: If I'm right about the things I said about you, you may end up trying to convince yourself of something that's not true just so you don't have to deal with my smugness (not that it would actually exist) and that would take you farther away from being able to process those emotions, and if I'm wrong, at least you can be more certain that you know your true feelings, and you can revel in my ignorance. Besides, I'm not likely to believe you if you tell me I'm wrong because you could just be saying that to deny me the satisfaction. When it comes to the stuff I say about myself, you're welcome to not believe it, but I'm not going to change my position, and any debate of its truthfulness isn't likely to be productive. I can't stop you from saying whatever you want to say, and you're just as entitled to expand on your thoughts as I am, but I don't want to turn this into an argument. Moreover, when I'm sad, I pretty much entirely stop defending myself, so I'm not going to be much of a match for you in an argument, and I'm not going to be able to provide you with the frustrated escalation and release of emotions that you generally seem to seek when you're upset. I wish I could make things better for you, but I'll likely have to settle for just not making things worse. If it'll make you feel better, give me a piece of your mind.

					<section>
						Although I suppose you could try to take p025's final response at face value, I see quite a few indications that p025 is putting on a show for me: For one thing, when she's talking about how great she's been doing since our breakup, I can't help but notice how the way she describes her feelings is almost word-for-word exactly how she would describe what she thinks I'm feeling right now. (I know this because she would frequently use that kind of wording to describe my feelings when she was upset at me for traveling or whatever else.) For another thing, you'll notice how she says that "<em>they</em>" texted me which directly counterdicts how she originally said that <em>she</em> texted me. Even if she was dared to hand over her phone for her friends to do whatever they want with, with how much she can't stand not knowing things, there's no way she wouldn't immediately try to figure out what they did. A quick deletion (within a few minutes) would also be the only way I wouldn't have seen the message before she deleted it. It's actually not entirely unreasonable to believe that she didn't have her phone for half the night since she has a tendency to lose her phone even when she's not drunk, but as tasteless as they are with their dares, I don't believe that her friends would steal her phone to secretly message her ex, even if they were able to get the phone unlocked (which is also highly doubtful). Even if her phone actually was missing for half the night, though, the evidence seems to indicate that it doesn't have much relevance to this particular situation. You'll also notice how she went from untempered aggression the night before to calm indifference the next day after I called out her aggression and invited her to give me a piece of her mind.
					</section>
					<section>
						I've been trying to figure out why p025 would be so aggressive with me during this interaction when our other interactions had been rather civil, and I have some theories, but as you've seen for yourself, sometimes my theories are wildly inaccurate, so it would be smart to leave the door open to other possibilities. For what it's worth, though, I think it might be that enough time has gone by that p025's feelings of love for me have started to fade, but the pain has been slower to go away, and since it's easier to hate people who have hurt you, she's started fostering a negative opinion of me now that she doesn't have so many fond feelings preventing it. Add to that being caught off-guard by me reaching out to her, and it's not too hard to see how she could end up taking an aggressive defensive posture. There's also the obvious potential contribution of her being drunk, but I've only ever seen her get happy after getting drunk, so I don't want to make any assumptions about how an impaired mind would influence her emotions in other ways; moreover, she wasn't drunk the next day, but she still seemed to want to hurt me. As for why she would act so indifferent the next day, I pretty much already said how it's likely that she read what I said and (probably subconsciously) decided that indifference would be a more effective means of hurting me, since it would make it seem like I was wrong about her, and anger wouldn't necessarily have as much of an effect after I invited her to express it. Especially after rereading the conversation, though, I think there's a good chance that her decision to go the indifference route was additionally influenced by her potential perception that I was being pretentious: Although I make an effort to speak in a way people understand (most readily observable in-person) and I haven't really had this problem with other people, I know that the formal way I speak and the logical way I walk through my emotions can make it seem like I have a reasonably good handle on the situation even when I say I don't (just like right now), and p025 has said numerous times in the past that I sound pretentious when I'm saying basically anything. ("Pretentious" is her word.) Recently, an undisclosed friend of mine said how they thought I was intimidating because of how smart I was (and because I was male), and I'm sure there are some other people who are intimidated to some degree in some circumstances, but p025 has been the only one who has expressed irritation towards what she considers to be me acting superior to her (and it didn't help that she didn't have any suggestions for how I could prevent that). I think, like my undisclosed friend, p025 is intimidated by me except, rather than recognizing it for what it is, she gets defensive and interprets the feeling as pretentiousness. p025 and I have also had many problems between us arising from my attempts to identify the origins of the differences of our feelings towards a given subject and resolve them because she feels her emotions without delving too deeply into why they are what they are, and by trying to find the underlying cause of her emotions, it seems to her that I'm trying to say that what she's feeling isn't real, so she gets upset. Even though I said that I was having a hard time and that I wished the best for p025, with how formally and systematically I addressed my situation and what I thought she was feeling, it's not too much of a stretch for me to believe that p025 saw the long explanation of my thoughts as a subtle demonstration of my superiority and that she thought I was trying to invalidate her emotions. In such an event, it wouldn't be particularly shocking for her to respond by trying to demonstrate her superiority to me and to invalidate my emotions. Who really knows what was actually going on, though, but if I was right about anything I said, I'd like to make it known that <span class="h4">I didn't intend for my words to be interpreted in that way</span>.

										Well, last night before midnight, I randomly got a message on Snapchat from p025, but when I went to look at it a little while later, I saw that it had been deleted. In the absence of any other theories to explain it, I thought that she might have been feeling sentimental and wanted to say something on a significant day of the year but then decided against it. That theory was bolstered by the fact that I had recently dropped off a number of nice things for her while I was also dropping off a necessary thing; I could see that she was following my Snapchat story and knew I recently arrived in her favorite city of New Orleans; and based on the last interaction we had, it wouldn't have been exceptionally shocking. I had been keeping to myself because I knew it was painful for her to talk to me, so I hadn't been planning on saying anything to her, but if my theory was correct, it may have been that she was just scared of reaching out, so I thought I'd wait and give her a generic "happy New Year" when the time came to show her that she doesn't have to be scared of me. When I did that, though, p025 asked why I was talking to her, and it turned out that the deleted message was a result of a dare by her friends at a New Year's Eve party (which seems like a rather distasteful dare, but with how they play, I'm not shocked it happened). I apologized and tried to get myself out of the conversation, especially since p025 did not seem happy at all, and it seemed like it might have been over, but then after some time had passed, p025 came back to tell me how she had just finished sleeping with a guy and how I was the one who needed the well-wishes, not her. I was not prepared for this turn of events, and although I was trying to let go of what happened earlier because I knew I had accidentally brought her pain to the surface, she got me with that part. I told her that I had thoughts on the situation but that I stand by the well-wishes. Naturally, p025 being p025, she couldn't handle not knowing what thoughts I had, and I think she was also trying to trap me into an argument because she would do that from time to time in an effort to get her frustrations out, but I refused to tell her right then because she was surely drunk and still needing to process this development, and no good would come out of throwing more onto everything else. I told her that I'd tell her tomorrow (today) if she still wanted to know then, and unsurprisingly, she did. I went into great detail about what I thought was motivating her behavior and how her behavior made me feel and how she doesn't need to worry about me leading a better life without her because there's still a lot I'm struggling with. When I was done, p025 decided to change her strategy to feigned indifference, and she proceeded to tell me how she's actually living a great life, not the depressed one I'm imagining, and that she's slept with the one guy plenty of times since me, so the fact that she did while we were talking was no big deal. (It's worth noting that I'm pretty sure this guy is one she's used to keep herself satisfied between relationships in the past.) I could tell that she was lying about how okay she was, but I had done my best to create a judgement-free environment, and I can't force her to come to terms with her emotions. It's also likely that she disregarded my concerns about her potentially ending up in a bad place like she did when she got divorced, and I'm not so sure whether all of the hard work we invested into overcoming her anger is actually going to make it past our relationship (although the way she treats me isn't necessarily representative of how she generally handles her anger). I've been somewhat successful in walking myself through everything and making allowances for the pain p025 is in and how she copes with that, but it's still hard.

As for before versus after being drunk, the only real difference I saw was the strategy she used to hurt me: She started off with anger, but when I basically invited her to get mad at me, she tried to make it seem like I meant nothing to her and like she's better off without me.

										She doesn't have it all figured out. She's sleeping with people partly because she takes it less seriously, but I think the largest influences at this time are that it distracts her and makes her feel good and then she has the added bonus that she can make me feel bad at the same time. She's told me before how she uses it to make herself feel better, and she can lie to me all she wants now, but I know she hasn't already gotten comfortable with a life without me and decided that she's going to enjoy playing around. Let's not forget (not that you would know) that she had been with hardly any people before she got divorced, but afterwards, she fit a whole lot of people into a short period of time until she started recovering a little bit and slowing down. I wish she had other ways of coping because this way doesn't make me feel very good, but I'm very much unconvinced that this is just the life she's decided to adopt.

										However, even when she has healed more, I know this wouldn't be drastically different from the life she decided to live.

I also don't think it's only what she's doing that's affecting me but also the fact that I've been conditioned to have a rather unhealthy view of the whole subject, so any time I have to confront it, it really digs deep and messes with me.

						It's nice to put conversations in at the beginning of an entry because it's an easy way to get started, but I need to start saving them until the end, so I don't find myself in this kind of position.

						Although the road to this point has been fairly rocky, I'm not feeling as overwhelmed anymore, and my mind's tendency towards optimism is starting to try to brighten and direct my future. I still have a lot of uncertainty, but with a little bit clearer of a mind and more time to think about it, I've gotten a little bit more of my future mapped out. The most immediate thing in my future is to just see cool stuff on this trip I'm on. It turns out that I acquired misleading information about the venue of Bio Summit, and apparently, there's no actual in-person event in Boston; it's all going to be virtual. On the one hand, that's annoying because virtual events are lame, but on the other hand, the fact that I thought there was an in-person event helped me prepare for and start this trip, and considering how I've stopped everything in Louisiana to finish this massive entry and it's taken me so long to finish it and Boston is pretty far away from Louisiana, it'll be nice not needing to rush there, so I can see more cool things along the way. <span class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/31">(Bio Summit has actually already happened by the time I finish this.)</span> I'm still planning on going to Boston because I might as well at this point; the argument of likely not having a better opportunity for a long time still holds; and I'm just not ready to be done. I was expecting my parents to freak out when I told them that there's actually no real reason for me to go to a place as "dangerous" as Boston at such a "dangerous" time of year (although the North in winter can be dangerous to an extent if you're not prepared), and I was somewhat right, but I could hardly believe it when they did a total 180 and acted kind-of okay with it. I'm wondering if invoking the name of God made a difference or something; it was crazy. <span class="elaborate obvious">Conversation</span>

It could just as easily be argued that God led me to believe that the conference was in Boston in order to make sure I was here where I'm supposed to be, so your argument that evil is leading me astray doesn't carry much weight. No one specifically stated that the conference was in Boston, so no one was lying to me, but based on the website and what <span class="person p0">one of the organizers</span> would say about it, a lot of hints were dropped that stuff was going on in Boston, and I wasn't able to get confirmation for a long time, so I went with what I assumed to be true.

							Well, the acceptance lasted a few days, at least.
						</aside>
						Although I don't know of anyone in the southern part of the United States, more towards the Northeast, there actually are a few people I know, in particular, <span class="person p010">one friend</span>, <span class="person p0">one cousin</span>, and some people I knew at Boston University. It'll be nice to see some familiar faces, although I'm not anguishing in loneliness nearly as much as I was before. Along the way, I have a side project of trying to isolate and maintain some glowing bacteria from the ocean, but it's not going to be easy, so we'll see how that goes. I'm also wanting to make a cool car alarm in case my home gets stolen, but I've been here so long that I think I'm just going to end up working on it on the road (maybe) because I don't want to delay any longer. My original plan was to stay in Louisiana until I could get the alarm put together. After seeing the Northeast, I'll take the scenic route back, and then I think I'm going to overshoot home by a little bit, so I can see p019 and p032 before I stop moving around so much. (Going to Cape Girardeau to visit people wouldn't be as big of a commitment since it's closer.) After that, I'll be with my parents for a little while. Visiting people much more frequently than I have been is going to be an important part of my life from this point forward, although, at the same time, soon after being with my parents, I think I'm going to get down to business. P2 has been interested in this one TV show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clarke%27s_Amazing_Spaces">Amazing Spaces</a> in which these random regular people decide to build tiny but cool houses for cheap, and it seemed to me that it would be nice to go straight to a paid-off house rather than paying tons of money in rent for a place I don't even own in the end (or being in debt for years paying even more money for a house) and for which I'll have to work all that much more in order to make payments, so I'm going to ask p1 to look for some cheap open plots of land. Being a (mostly retired) real estate agent, p1 is always telling people to use him in their housing endeavors, and he may or may not think my plan is a good idea, but it's not like I'm going to abandon my plan if he doesn't help me, and I seriously doubt that it'll be necessary for me to look for land on my own. Once I get a nice (likely small) plot of land, I'll set up a basic foundation and plop a shipping container (or similar) on top of it, and then proceed to renovate it into a house. It'll be a fairly lengthy endeavor to turn the shipping container completely into a comfortable house, but once I have electricity and running water in one corner of the shipping container, I'll be better off than I have been in my car, and I can just move right in. I'm never going to be completely done with the house anyway because I'll keep having ideas of how I can make it better. By living cheaply and having a paid-off house, I won't need to waste my life away working too much, and I can also have plenty of time to pursue my own endeavors such as my community biology lab. (I plan on it being much more than just a biology lab, especially relating to electronics, but I haven't decided upon a good general term for it.) I'm hoping that Bio Summit will provide me with a good starting point, and before I even have my own tiny house, I'm going to be taking steps to turn the lab into a reality. I may ask p1 to either search for two plots of land (to build a lab on) or to also search for a cheap rental area for my lab to be housed in. <span class="elaborate">(A non-profit could rent things more easily than I could.)</span>
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							For a rental property of my own, I'd have to work to make every dollar myself; for a rental property owned by a non-profit, the burden of payment is spread across a whole organization consisting of many people, and the money can come from more diverse sources such as donations, grants, and fundraisers. (I very much do not want to make an organization which requires and supports itself on membership dues, though.)
						</aside>
						I'm not sure what my rate of progress will be for that, but I'm not one to put off doing cool things when they could be done now. Naturally, all of this stuff costs money, but as is usually the case, it's not as much money as most people would imagine, and I'm hoping to save up some money while I'm traveling, and I'll also surely be working some amount while I'm with my parents. I'm not sure what my future holds beyond that, and I still have a whole slew of personal insecurities and worries, but I've been broken up with p025 over 50% longer now (January 31<sup>st</sup>) than I was when I first set out to write this, and I don't feel completely lost anymore. I can even manage some excitement for the things I do have planned.

						I ended up saying stuff about my journal <span class="elaborate">here</span> which could be considered moderately important, but I thought it took away from my focus on p025, so I hid it away.

					<aside data-heading="Journal stuff">
						<section>
							Although I wish I would've typed up this entry much sooner in order to better capture the depth of my feelings in the moment, it was hard for me to get into it soon after we broke up, and after that, I was working, and after that, I was traveling some, but in the new year, I wanted to get a fresh start, so I decided to put off everything until I could finish this entry. Although there were some legitimate difficulties such as setting up a way to refer to people without getting their names included in the version history of this website or how I had a conscious or subconscious aversion to typing this because of the sad feelings it would instill in me, there was also a lot of dumb stuff like me getting distracted with random dumb stuff or me just being ridiculously slow, and as a result, it's ended up taking me a solid month to type this all up. It's a good thing I switched over to talking about this and then transcribing it or else I'd surely still be working on it. That's absolutely ridiculous for an entry. Then again, it's absolutely ridiculous how huge this entry is. I have a special page on this website where I keep entries I write in the moment but which I can't put on the main part of my journal because it's not up-to-date yet. There are currently 76 variably finished entries, and as I look at the scroll bar on the code editor I use to type this (<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section">Visual Studio</a>), I can see that this single entry composes approximately a third of the content of the entire page. Moreover, this page has apparently gotten so massive that my code editor has started moving rather slowly at times because it can't handle processing the whole page very well anymore. It's made me think about how I might need to reconsider my organization scheme for the journal as a whole because, for a while now, I've been thinking that I'd only divide it up into something like 4 sections (so far), generally corresponding to when I asked someone to read my journal, but I know that even everything I have on this special page is only a fraction of what would be in one of those sections (depending on the section), and if my editor is struggling now, I might need to divide things up more just so I can effectively work on the entries. I'll probably end up just waiting to see if it becomes a problem, though. (I also don't know how good of a user experience it would be to have such large sections.)
						</section>
						<section class="afterthought" data-date="2023/1/31">
							It turns out that the slowness of my code editor was primarily due to maintaining a huge undo history because, when I closed out of everything and later brought it back up (which reset what could be undone), everything was working just fine again. It's still an open question how the size of the sections will affect the user experience. I'm planning on adding bookmarking, but it's also an open question how much that would offset the size problem.
						</section>
						<section>
							Although I know I've already made references to it, let me be clear in saying that I did indeed change p025's name for this journal. I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate the negative things I said about her in the past, but I'd say the biggest reason I'm obscuring her identity is because she absolutely hated the idea of our conversations being shown to my friends, but as I often think when p1 is describing a conversation to me, the exact wording can mean the difference between someone being completely justified and someone being completely misguided, and there are plenty of situations between p025 and me where I can easily see that being the case, so I'm not about to get rid of what I feel proves I'm not crazy. Technically, my close friends will still know who she is, relatively speaking (none of them actually ended up meeting her), but the world doesn't need to know who she is. It's also worth noting that I put a lot of thought into exactly how to change her name, and changing her name isn't the only thing I did to obscure her identity. I'm not going to tell you exactly what I took into account because that, in itself, can be a hint to the true information <span class="elaborate obvious">examples</span>, but I assure you I was quite thorough.
							<aside data-heading="Examples">
								If I told you I changed the breed of dog she has, for instance, you could narrow your search to people who had a different breed of dog which could still fit my description of hers. Also, if I made an all-inclusive list of everything I took into account, you could know that everything I didn't list is true, and you could start your search there.
							</aside>
							As I've gotten back into contributing more to my journal, I've been reminded once again of potential privacy concerns, and <span class="elaborate">I don't really think it's possible</span> to secure everything 100% without either not letting this journal be online or public in any way or not talking about anyone else ever (which wouldn't work), but I can try to make it as difficult as possible.
							<aside data-heading="Explanation">
								It takes next to nothing to be able to track down a person from my journal: If I mention wishing someone a happy birthday in my high school band, you could get a yearbook or some other record of who was in the band at that time, see who has a birthday on that day, and there's a decent chance there's only one person who fits; if I mention going to college with someone I used to be neighbors with, without even specifying which house I was talking about, you could get a record of who owned the surrounding houses of each place I lived, see who had kids who went to a college I went to, and there's a decent chance there's only one person who fits; if I mention someone from nepal having a crush on me, you could look at the exchange student records from that time and get a very short list of potential candidates, and you could talk to each of them to figure out exactly who it was. Some of those things may be harder to do than I imagine, but some may not be, and I typically divulge more than one or two vague pieces of information about a person, anyway. I can change people's names all I want, but if I say basically anything about anyone, I open up the very real possibility that a sufficiently motivated individual would be able to figure out who they are. What am I supposed to do about that?
							</aside>
							I've been considering with increasing preference changing everyone's names and providing my close friends with a special way of accessing the real names. I'm also worried about the version history <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> keeps, especially as it pertains to removing or altering content pertaining to a person <span class="elaborate">if they ask me to</span>.
							<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
								Mainly with people who I know well and who I say a lot about, I want to give them an opportunity to look over what I said about them before I let other people read the journal in its entirety, so I can make sure I didn't put in anything they would consider sensitive. This would also extend to when the journal is up-to-date, and I'm planning on adding another chunk of my life.
							</aside>
							I've already pretty much decided that I need to figure out how to eliminate the version history when I've finally gotten this website basically finished because my practices at the beginning of making this website weren't especially as secure as they are now, but version history would instantly become a problem again the moment I added anything. I probably need to migrate the website off of GitHub, but it might be hard for me to find another website hoster that serves me so well for free. Luckily, I'm not rich and famous yet, so I have time to figure out these problems while only risking my close friends finding out a little more about one of my other close friends than they're comfortable with.
						</section>
					</aside>
					<section>
						Although it may turn out that my hopes are too high, I'm hoping that, by finishing this entry, in some way, I can get closure and begin to move into a new chapter in my life. As I've grown up, I've heard people talk about "growing pains" as a reference to young people having difficulties as they get older, but I've always thought of it as an unnecessarily specific way of referring to generic difficulties: Life isn't easy, and I've had my share of problems, but why differentiate between adult problems and young person problems when they have a similar emotional effect? If there was ever going to be a time when I'd say I've experienced growing pains, though, this would be it. Adults may not have their lives totally figured out, but they usually have some kind of direction, so feeling completely lost is generally more of a problem for younger people, and I've definitely experienced quite a bit of pain as a result. Then again, what I'm experiencing would probably be likened more to a quarter-life crisis, in which case I still think the phrase "growing pains" is unnecessary. <span class="elaborate obvious">Side note</span>
						<aside data-heading="Side note">
							Maybe, by going through all of this now, I'll avert a mid-life crisis. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though.
						</aside>
						I don't think I fully captured how completely lost and exceptionally insecure I've been, but I've spent enough time on this entry as it is, and during the vast expanse of time I've been working on this, I've slowly started to make a comeback, anyway. No matter how much time passes, though, I know I'll always care about p025, and I'll always be sad about the pain that I've caused her. As we go our separate ways, I hope that p025 is able to move into a new chapter in her own life and that maybe she can find it within herself to not think too harshly of me. Regardless, p025 means a lot to me, and <span class="h4">I wish her all the happiness in the world</span>.

						Friday, January 13, 2023
					</h2>
					<section>
						I was going to structure this in paragraph form to make everything flow nicely, but it's just not worth it. Here's an overview of my thoughts for the day:
					</section>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It seems as though I'm determined to not write about my breakup with p025, but you probably already knew that. It keeps getting harder to put everything else off, but I still find a way to waste my time (like typing this).
						</li>
						<li>
							It keeps getting harder to justify to my parents why I haven't left Louisiana without telling them about my journal or mentioning p025.
						</li>
						<li>
							I restarted copying over the significant portion of my journal that's in notebooks on January 9<sup>th</sup> in an effort to get me thinking about my journal and primed to talk about my breakup (which hasn't been entirely unsuccessful), and just today, I tracked down the entry which mentioned when I first started copying things over (and then stopped after I hardly did anything). It was on June 18, 2018. It's taken me 4 and a half years to get back around to copying over my journal. That's not even to mention how I learned how to make websites like this in late 2016 and very soon after conceived of digitizing my journal (or maybe I thought of it before I learned how). It's absolutely ridiculous when I see how much time has passed for some things. I am slightly better off copying things now than I was before, and I have been making more progress (even though the progress should be on my entry about p025), and I'm hoping, after having gotten into the habit of devoting time to my journal, I can keep copying a little bit more each day even after the reason for prioritizing my journal has passed. I have a list of things to add about my childhood since I went through that part of my life the quickest, but I'm just copying first, and then when I'm done, if I'm still motivated to add more stuff, I can go back and do it then. (I probably won't be all that motivated, but that's part of the point.)
						</li>
						<li>
							I'm actually quite impressed by the progress I've made in programming certain things, but just like it was in college when I had homework, the progress comes at the cost of doing what I should be doing. In case you're interested, expanding the functionality of the search page on this website is one thing I've been working on, and I thought it would take me something like a week of programming to figure out how to identify the entries where people and topics are mentioned and then link there and even show a text snippet of the location, but I cranked that out in the past 2 days with most of the work being done on the first day. I'll probably end up using that to help people find and approve entries about themselves before I make my journal more widely availible, but I definitely won't be using that to descibe how I feel about p025. I also figured out how to make my <a href="https://epicenterprograms.github.io/lists/">to-do list</a> display the information again just today. It turns out that there was an error in something else that processed where to find the information, and even though I reference that code on a few different websites, it only broke my to-do list because it used the code slightly differently, and that's where the error was. Based on the dates of things in my to-do list, that error has been hiding out for over 3 years. I have to update the lists (technically, many lists can be stored on the site) before I can start making regular use of them again, and I'm not sure how this development will affect my (heavy) usage of a certain note-taking app on my phone, but from just the brief time I had to get reacquainted with the website, <span class="h3">it's become quite obvious that, if anything, my memories of it being the best to-do list ever have been understated</span>. The first thing I added to it, though, was an item telling me to finish talking about p025.

						Due to a series of events that aren't worth my time explaining, I discovered today that the picture I put on Wikipedia showing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can_telephone#Operation">how to make can phones go around corners</a> was removed on July 14<sup>th</sup> by an anonymous user who apparently didn't believe that such a thing was possible. Their edit summary was, "stop writing anti scientific [b***s***]!" Being the person who took that picture after experiencing it working first-hand, I felt that the picture was sufficiently scientific, so I restored it. I'm surprised someone making an edit with that description was able to go unchallenged for so long, especially an anonymous user. I guess the page doesn't get much traffic, and since only one picture was deleted, the article still seemed complete enough to someone unfamiliar with the page that no one was inspired to check the version history. I'm just doing my part to ensure that my fellow tin can telephonists don't fall victim to the war on science.

						It turns out that my parents' acceptance of me not being home with them wasn't destined to last long. There were some indications before, but just last night, my parents called me, and much more in-line with what I expected, p1 started going on and on about how I need to come home, so I can get my life back on track and help him while I'm at it. (The conversation with p1 accepting me being gone was on January 24<sup>th</sup>, by the way.) He accused me multiple times of staying in Louisiana so long in order to find a girl to move in with (I didn't want to say <span class="elaborate">the real reasons</span>),
						<aside data-heading="Reasons">
							You should know that the reason I haven't left Louisiana is because I've been spending so much time writing about p025 in this journal. An additional reason popped up on Wednesday and Thursday, though, when my car broke down, and I had to spend a bunch of money to get it fixed (and now I need to build up my money more). I didn't want to tell my parents about any of that because I didn't want to deal with (more) lectures about girls and p025; I didn't want to deal with lectures about what I might be putting in my journal (which I've technically told them about, but it's been so many years that they've surely forgotten that it exists or at least don't know that I'm still working on it); and I didn't want to deal with lectures about how I'm living my life on the edge by traveling and living out of my car.

						and he told me things like how I need to stop letting girls manipulate me into putting off what I need to do for my future and how doing work (with him at home) is the best thing I can do to help me think. He told me how there's a lot of work I need to do in order to make up for all the money he and p2 have spent on me over the years, and he also threw in how I should be spending some time with him before he dies soon when his smoker lungs give out. To be fair, p1 had recently been to the hospital because he was having a particularly difficult time breathing, and it turned out that he had an infection making his emphysema worse, so that surely brought his mortality to the forefront of his mind, and I was actually worried about him too, but if this conversation with him told me anything, it's that I need a little more time on my own to fully recover and acquire more direction in my life. I also think it's important to note that, if I dropped everything to spend time with p1 "before he dies soon", I wouldn't have done anything for the past 10 years. I was relieved when I heard it was an infection as opposed to a general decline because, to me, that indicates he still has a decent amount of time left. He needs to hold out a little longer because I'm not ready to come back yet. I'd feel worse about his lungs slowly getting worse over time if he didn't weaponize it against me and get angry at anyone who tries to help him stop smoking. During the course of our conversation, he implied that, if his lungs did give out, it would be partially my fault because he smokes less or not at all when he's working on stuff, but he "can't" work on stuff if I don't come home to help him. That's no worse, though, than him blaming me for a car accident if I'm in the passenger seat and don't take the wheel to save us when he's coughing or something. I tried to tell p1 again how it's because of stuff like he was saying right then that I don't go to him for advice, and I tried to explain to him how his words bring about that response, but he didn't care about what I had to say, and he reasserted that he knew what was truly best for me because he was so much more experienced than me and because I'm just like him; I'm just too dumb (because I'm young) to see how we're exactly alike and how his advice will end up producing the best result. In case you're wondering, p2 knows I'm nothing like p1; she just doesn't want to take sides. Many of you may be taken aback by the course of this conversation, but nothing said here is anything I haven't heard before or expected on some level, and my ability to deaden myself to all of it has only improved over time. I originally had this as an update after the conversation with my parents I referenced in <span data-revisit="add a link">the January 8<sup>th</sup> entry</span> in order to show I was actually right to expect them to freak out about me still going to Boston and stuff, but as I rattled on longer and longer, it became clear to me that this needed to be its own entry.

						Unrelated to that stuff, also during the conversation with my parents (really just a lecture by p1), it came out that, in 64 years with a large percentage of that time being spent in and around the "dangerous" city of St. Louis, p1 has only gotten his wallet stolen by a stranger one time. Moreover, it wasn't so much of a mugging as p1 thinks will happen to me at any moment so much as it was an opportunist who grabbed and ran. (No weapons or threats were involed.) Granted, he has gotten things stolen by his <em>friends</em> many times, and he's gotten himself into plenty of other unfavorable situations, but those things are avoidable if you don't live your life like p1; it's the incidence of crime by strangers that's most applicable to what people should watch out for, especially if you're just passing through. Now, I'm sure that, if p1 could respond to this, he'd say how this isn't true at all; more bad things would've happened to him if he wasn't a native and very wary; and he may even dig up one more story of a stranger doing him wrong; but your personality and how you live your life have a huge impact on what kind of people you end up associating with and what kind of predicaments you find yourself in. p025 and I are similar in age and have lived in similar areas, but p025's description of what has happened throughout her life isn't even remotely similar to the things that have happened in my life. Even with p11 who's male like me and lived in <em>exactly</em> the same area as me, when he talks about the things he's done and the experiences he's had, it draws a stark contrast to my life. Many things are the same no matter who you talk to, but there are also a huge number of things that are completely different depending on who you talk to. In large part, we create our own worlds, but it's not always easy to see that because our expectations influence our perceptions, and once we create our own worlds, we find ourselves in an environment where even an unbiased study of the people around us would largely support what we believe (since we're surrounded by like-minded individuals). With how easy it is to create our own worlds without any help, it's no wonder how the internet and social media are so successful as creating confirmation bias. I'm not above this, but I recognize its existence, and with how so few people are like me much at all and how I get along with such a wide variety of other people, it can be easier for me to identify where my world ends and where the real world begins. (It also gets easier as experiences are built up over time.) I think it's worth noting that, even though p2 grew up in basically the same place as p1 and she also doesn't have a favorable opinion of the city, her experiences are very much different from the experiences of p1. P1 would attribute that to her being female, and that definitely makes a difference, but I don't believe for a second that it explains everything. <span class="elaborate">I don't live my life like p1</span>, so I don't have the same experiences as him, and if someone that prone to high-risk situations can go that long without getting "mugged" in an area that actually does have a reasonably high crime rate, I'm not worried about my general caution being insufficient.
						<aside data-heading="Differences">
							A small sampling of the differences between us (when we were about the same age) is that I don't get very close to people who regularly commit crimes and/or get us both into trouble; I don't try to pick up random girls in bars only to discover that their boyfriend is nearby; I don't get into fist fights with anyone ever; and I don't mouth off to the cops and get myself thrown in jail. P1 would have an explanation for every one of these situations (which I've heard before), and he would argue that the only reason I haven't experienced these things is because he made sure I grew up in a good neighborhood, but I find it strange how a change in neighborhood can <em>completely</em> eliminate <em>all</em> of those things, and I further find it strange how I've known some people in the same neighborhood as me who have had some experiences that aren't entirely different from the things p1 describes.
