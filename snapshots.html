					<li>
						I didn't get to eat lunch with <span class="p2"></span> as I had been hoping to start doing on Fridays because I woke up so late.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="p1"></span> ended up jumpstarting someone's car when the person asked us for help when they saw us standing around next to the parking lot. (I left before the action happened, though.)
					</li>
					<li>
						I did an easy 20 pull-ups at the recreation center (enough to build up my strength, but not so much that I'm sore later).
					</li>
					<li>
						I saw <span data-revisit>(what I assumed to be)</span> <span class="p2"></span>'s name on my advisor's appointment sign-up sheet.
					</li>
					<li>
						I played Super Smash Brothers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="e35" data-revisit>
							I did my laundry while playing Super Smash Brothers even though it should have been done earlier in the day.
						</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="e35" data-revisit>
							I went to bed late (like I will today) because I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to thoroughly represent my emotions in my entries because I knew I'd be typing this. (And since typing this, I'm doubting everything.)

				<section>
					Wednesday was <span class="p1"></span>'s birthday. As should be expected with anyone I grow so close to, I couldn't just let this special day pass by without doing something cool for her. Knowing that her favorite animal (and future animal of study) is a bat, I set out to make <span class="p1"></span> an origami bat (which I could hopefully get to flap). After searching the Internet the day before, I came across a number of places which claimed to have instructions for making a flapping origami bat. I picked one and started folding it, but when I got to the end, although it flapped, it didn't really look much like a bat. Dissatisfied, I found different instructions which seemed to give me more of what I wanted and resolved to make it the next day. (It was too late for me to finish it that night.) When Wednesday arrived, I tried to go especially fast through my morning routine <note-><div><div>I've done this twice before, both times so I could try to finish my giant drawing for the following art class.</div></div></note-> so I could have 30 minutes before class to work on making the bat. Although I did get the 30 minutes, making the bat was a long process, so I ended up woking on it a little during class as well as a fair amount between classes. Once I was finished, though, I had a very realistic bat which flapped. I was ready to surprise <span class="p1"></span>.

					When I walked in to Biology, I spotted <span class="p1"></span> and noticed she was sitting in a different place. I was a little confused, but there was still an open seat next to her, so I promptly filled it. The proceeding conversation went something like this:

					As you might imagine, I was rather taken aback by this sudden display of hostility. Although I seemed to have smoothed things over, I didn't expect such a scenario to arise in what's otherwise a mutually enjoyable relationship. Right away, I suspected that there was more to <span class="p1"></span>'s hostility than just tiredness. Furthermore, I suspected that I didn't have to look very far for the reason: As you know, I developed a friendly rivalry with <span class="p1"></span>, similar to the one I had with <span class="p3"></span>. Consequentially, it would be fairly common for me to dish out light-hearted insults. Aware of the potential to hurt her feelings by going to far, I was ever vigilant in my efforts to keep myself in check; however, it wouldn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that I messed up somewhere along the line or that, like <span class="p3"></span>, she didn't let on that the insults were slowly taking their toll. It could be that her tiredness weakened her ability to keep things to herself and inspired her to seek refuge from what would ordinarily be _________________________________.

					I've decided that I'm not going to mess around with trying to indicate my emotions in these planned entries because I might change how I classify things later, anyway, and it's clear that the lack of definitive completion in my emotion indication is preventing me from making progress. I always planned on proof-reading these entries before I added them to the main journal, so it's not like I'm really giving myself much more work to do later. I have no intention of getting rid of any way of people knowing the feelings with which I say something, but I need to have a fully-developed system before I try to start implementing it. Hopefully, things will be easier once I have a clear idea of how to do things; however, if that's not the case, I guess I'll have to devise a simpler way of indicating my emotions because this isn't working (but it's too valuable to eliminate completely). With any luck, I might start making some progress now.

					The first thing I'm sure you'll notice is that this date is prior to the one you just read (if you're someone who reads the dates). Ordinarily, I'd prefer to do things sequentially, but by the time I get around to typing all of that other stuff up, all of the interesting things that happened to me today would be old news. Since it's an especially inconvenient time for me to be recounting my day, I'm going to try to be brief. I'm just going to number things, so I don't have to spend time transitioning; everything will be numbered in order of increasing importance.
				</section>
				<ol start="7" reversed>
					<li>
						I did my laundry today. Things were a little more crowded than expected probably because the washing machine room was flooded over the weekend, and no one could do their laundry. In case I don't say it in something preceeding this, I chose Wednesdays to do my laundry because my classes end at 2:20, and my only class on Thursday starts at 1:30 (the same one that ends at 2:20).
					</li>
					<li>
						I saw <span class="p2"></span> at dinner today, and I didn't even try to walk by and say "hi". Granted, I did get there late, she was finished eating, and she was especially far off in the corner, but I consider it a win nonetheless. That's not to say that I'm over the nonsense which I'm sure you're familiar with by now, but I think the decreased contact (as if there was ever much contact in the first place) is helping take some of the edge off. Occasionally, I run into her when she's a little extra dressed-up or maybe she doesn't completely ignore me, and I feel myself wanting to get a little too excited, but I think things are generally headed in the right direction.
					</li>
					<li>
						I had a Biology test today. As is typically the case, I somehow didn't manage to find the time to really study beforehand with the exception of a small amount of time immediately preceeding the test. As is also typical, I had difficulties finishing the test on time, but I don't think I did too badly. Maybe if I studied, the answers would come to me more quickly. (For the record, though, there aren't only frivolous reasons behind my failures to study.)
					</li>
					<li>
						My Chemistry class was canceled today. The reason behind it was that the professor was going to present his research later that day. He invited the class to come, and I actually decided to go. (What did you expect? I'm a nerd.) There were a number of professors there, but I'd say the vast majority was composed of students. It turns out that my professor is researching more cost-effective and versitile ways of creating carbon compounds. (I should have seen that one coming: what chemist isn't doing that?) It was moderately interesting and caused me to have to rush through lunch to get to my next class on time.
					</li>
					<li>
						My electric razor stopped working today for no apparent reason. Yesterday, it had run out of charge, so I plugged it in to charge over night. When I tried to use it today, however, it just wouldn't turn on. Sometimes it would do that the first time I turned it on after charging (still for no apparent reason), but it would always resolve itself. Such was not the case this time. In response, I put off all of the other necessary things I was going to do so I could order a new one. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to try to keep my rapidly-growing facial hair at bay with scissors. (Scissors are an awful thing to try to use as a replacement for an electric razor, particulary when you want a clean shave.)
					</li>  <!-- talk about Boys State -->
					<li>
						<span class="p7"></span> finally convinced me to let him move into my room. It seems that he was having problems with his roommate keeping him up late with loud noises, and with upcoming tests and stuff, <span class="p7"></span> was getting desperate. We had extensive talks about my reservations with him moving in, and I made sure to tell him how he needs to express his feelings to his roommate rather than stay silent, but over time, it seemed to me that <span class="p7"></span> had made at least a mild attempt to bring up his concerns, and it also seemed that he's reasonably capable of not making me feel awkward at every waking moment. Eventually, I agreed, and although he was happy, he didn't get quite as celebratory as he might have otherwise, probably because he knew how seriously I was taking this. Preliminary results seem to suggest that things will be okay, but I think there has to be more than one day of evidence to work with before such a statement could be said conclusively. Regardless, things will be certainly be more interesting from here on out.
					</li>  <!-- I changed something above here. -->
					<li>
						I reached the top of Google. As I was looking through my emails today (which apparently aren't causing notifications to be sent to my phone), I noticed two emails saying something I'd never seen before: a number of people had visited one of my websites. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the wesite was the one where I talked about <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/canphonesandcorners/">getting can phones to go around corners</a>. Apparently, in December, 123 users visited my site, and in January, 250 users did. None of them were even me! The average time spent on my website was about 40 seconds, and they generally only looked once. What I found particularly interesting was that 70% or so came from "referral", meaning that there's apparently a fair number of links out there on other websites which people are following to my website. (Alternatively, there's one link on a moderately popular website.) Even more interesting was that greater than 25% of people came from an "organic search", meaning that they searched Google and found my website. Considering how, last time I checked, my website was so far away from the top of the results that I couldn't find it, this came as quite a surprise to me. Naturally, the first thing I did was search for "how to make can phones go around corners", and what do I see at the very top of the results but my website!!!! I have no idea how this could have happened, but I've obviously done something right in those four years I hardly did anything (the site was published on February 3, 2014). When you make it to the top of Google, you know you've made it in life. Suddenly, I have this compulsion to do some maintainence on my website, so I can give my followers a better experience. Who knows: maybe when I get this month's update<note-><div><div>I didn't get updates before, presumably because my website wasn't important enough.</div></div></note-> I'll have more than 300 users who visited the site! Some of you may think that the overall importance of this part of my day should have ranked below <span class="p7"></span> moving in with me (or, in this case, above), but some of you would be wrong: Some people spend a lifetime trying to get to the top of Google but never achieve it (let's forget for a moment that Google isn't even a lifetime old); I, however, have beaten the odds and reached the pinnacle of Internet noteriety. For the forseeable future, <em>I</em> will be the authority on all things related to can phones and corners; <em>I</em> will be the go-to resource for solutions to "string"ent problems; and <em>I</em> will have influence over <em>hundreds</em> of people. My immortalization has already begun.

					Sunday was my Birthday! As time goes by, I feel like I should talk about something else or just wait until a different noteworthy event occurs, but I don't want to wait another whole year to talk about something so cool (as is typical), and I can throw in a few other interesting things as well.

					The day started off with gigantic snowflakes/clumps coming from the sky. Later on, I modified the <a href="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/cramped/seconds">countdowns on Cramped</a> to make annual countdowns wait for a day at 0 before resetting for the next year.

					Today was a rather unproductive day but fairly interesting. (Typing this doesn't help my productivity.) After waking up at 12:38pm, I went to breakfast and came back with the intent of working on some homework. However, remembering how I had started digitizing the things I need to write in this journal yesterday, I decided to finish it up (not counting things I hadn't written down yet). Hours later, I finally finished, and it was about time to go to dinner. I would have went right away, but I was delayed when one of <span class="p7"></span>'s friends came over and <span class="p7"></span> started giving me a bunch of Japanese food to try. (I also tried asking his friend what the proper way of saying "weirdo" is in Japanese to little success.) At dinner, who would I see but <span class="p2"></span>. I had seen her sitting by herself in a corner a number of times now, and through all of those times, I resisted the urge to sit with her (especially since she would enevitably get up and leave soon after I sat with her since she didn't have much food left and didn't want to play on her phone while I was talking to her<note-><div><div>There have been many times when I would see her finished with her food, not sit with her, and yet when I'm leaving, see her still sitting there playing on her phone (not using it to talk to someone). However, any time I've sat with her (with the possible exception of the first or second time), she has promptly gotten up and left once she had finished eating. I think it's more of a not-wanting-to-waste-time-when-she's-being-held-accountable sort of thing as opposed to a wanting-to-get-away-from-me-as-soon-as-possible thing, but who really knows?</div></div></note->). This time, though, I saw that she had a decent amount of food left, and it had been quite some time since I had sat with her last<note-><div><div>Even if she's not interested in a relationship (which I don't even know if I am), I'd still consider us more or less friends, and I sit with the rest of my friends more than that. (It's been at least a month or two.)</div></div></note->, so I decided to drop by. We talked, and everything seemed to go pretty well: the conversation wasn't nearly as dead as it normally is, and she seemed pretty cheerful and giggly<note-><div><div>Once again, giggly isn't quite the right word: she was just laughing a lot.</div></div></note->. When she finished eating and started to leave, I told her, "What? you don't want to play on your phone while you're having a conversation with me?", and she knew it was the truth. I think I made it through the whole encounter without acquiring another massive crush on her. Since I then found myself alone in a corner, I moved my plate with the rest of my food towards the center of the dining hall so I could be closer to the action (which was basically non-existent). As I was finishing up, one of the girls who regularly works in the dining hall came over to me and started asking me questions about what I thought of the gospel and how my life fits into it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting my dinner to go in that direction, and although she was fairly nice (just like the rest of them), it was still pretty awkward. I don't know what inspired her to come over to me when she never did before for the whole year up to now. On my way back to my room, I decided to take the elevator, and I was joined by three girls acting in a goofy manner; I wouldn't have thought much of it if it weren't for the fairly pungent smell of alcohol eminating from them. When I finally made it back to my room, I started working on this but remembered that there was some homework I really wanted to fininsh so it would seem like I had actually accomplished something today. After getting a few problems of that done, my parents called, and there went about an hour and a half of my time. While talking to them, I tried to bring up the idea of letting me travel abroad for a semester, and probably because of the way I established a certain context and eased into it, they almost seemed to be in agreement (or at least my dad did; who knows what my mom thought considering how she didn't have much an opportunity to offer her opinion on the subject). Once I had escaped the conversation, I finished the assignment I had started and resolved to quickly add this entry so there could be another small glimpse into my daily life (despite the fact that there are other longer and more important things that I want to write about but don't have time for). However, considering how it's 12:57am<note-><div><div>The date is still from "yesterday".</div></div></note-> and I effectively started this almost two hours ago, I don't think I'm doing very well on the "quickly" part. I haven't even gotten ready for bed yet; the constant recurrence of situation can be quite frustrating.

					As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.

I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between <span class="p3"></span> and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). <span class="p3"></span> is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

					Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the third of my pants that were a little too tight for me.<note-><div><div>They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance.

					<span class="p7"></span> offered to pay for a trip to Japan for me today. Although he has invited me to stay with him in Japan on numerous occasions, this is the first time that he seemed to be serious about a proposal of my visit (or at least serious enough that he offered to pay when he saw that finances posed a significant hurdle). There are a number of things I could say on this topic, but my main purpose here was to get the date recorded for future reference; I don't really have time for anything else, especially considering how it's crunch-time for finishing the website for <span class="3"></span>. You can be sure that I'll be talking about this later, though.

					I finally finished the website for <span class="p3"></span> (on Thursday). If you're paying attention, you'll notice that Thursday wasn't the day after <span class="p3"></span>'s birthday (that would have been Monday). Despite significant determination, I just couldn't get it done on time. For nearly two weeks, I've been getting miserable sleep in an effort to get things done as soon as possible: the first week averaged out to something like 5 hours of sleep a night, and starting after I woke up on Sunday going through Thursday, I got a total of about 5 hours of sleep. I felt like I was back at Boston University. I thought for sure I'd crash and not be able to keep up the sleep deprivation long enough to finish the website, but somehow, my body adapted and allowed me to stay relatively awake throughout that time. A little after 9:00 Thursday night, I sent <span class="p3"></span> texts consisting of the following:
				</section>
				<section style="padding: 0rem 10rem 0rem 10rem">
					"This is Robert Benson. I would appreciate it if you could go to this URL (preferably on a computer): https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/specialprojects/srt/bunnies. (There's an animation I made there.) I would also appreciate it if you could respond to this text at some point, so I could minimally know that you received it. It would mean a lot to me for you to see it, so I may make further attempts to cause such to be a reality."<br>
					...<br>
					"Also, happy late birthday. (I was supposed to tell you that in the first place.)"
				</section>
				<section>
					I spent a significant amount of time trying to convince myself that it didn't matter whether <span class="p3"></span> saw the animation, and I was initially successful, but after killing myself trying to get it finished, I can't help but think that it <em>does</em> matter. I haven't heard back from her, so I sent her a short text today asking if she received my texts. Tomorrow, I'll ask <span class="p9"></span> if she knows whether her number is still valid. If it's not, I still haven't deleted my Facebook account yet, and I know that <span class="p3"></span> has an account, so that's where I'll go next. I'm reasonably convinced that I'll be able to contact her through some means. I was also reasonably convinced that she'd be willing to respond to me if I requested it, but if it turns out that her phone number still works, it would seem that I was mistaken. I think the animation has an excellent mix of humor and thoughtfulness, and if she would watch it, I think that there would be a good chance that she would be willing to entertain the notion of giving me another chance. She has to see it, though.

					There are a number of things I should be doing, especially since I've been doing almost nothing but programming for nearly two weeks, but I'm just exhausted, and I want someone to help relieve me of some of this stress; this is as close as I can get to that. My parents are going to call tonight, and I'm wondering what I'm going to tell them because, eventually, my dad will stop talking, and they'll want to know what I've been doing and whether I've rectified all of the things they're disappointed in. (No.) I'm going to have to think hard about what I did besides programming for <span class="p3"></span> (which would be a terrible idea to tell them about) and then try to make it seem like that could have filled up my whole week. Luckily, they've convinced themselves that I rarely do anything productive, so it will be much more likely that they assume my lack of things to say about my week is an indication of how much time I've wasted rather than an indication of my reluctance to confide in them with my personal problems. I actually had a dream about my parents last night: It started off being more about me being held prisoner in my house and later shifted a little bit to my dad enforcing even more strict rules upon me and then leaving with my mom for a short time. In that time, I decided that the line had finally been crossed, and I coordinated an "escape" with my friends.<note-><div><div>They weren't really friends that you or I would know outside of the dream; they were just friends.</div></div></note-> I started packing up the most important stuff and loading it into my friend's car, but before I could get the last of my stuff, my parents came back and put an end to it. They treated me as if I was a little kid making an irrational decision to run away from home, and all I could think about was how I was all the more determined to get out of there the moment they left again. Even after waking up, the idea of escaping the condescension of my parents/dad and exploring the world in a car with my friends didn't seem too unappealing; however, I don't particularly expect it to happen. Tying things back into the original topic of this entry, I also had a dream about <span class="p3"></span> last night: Somehow, <span class="p3"></span> and I both ended up at a party thrown by <span class="p9"></span> (which meant to me that her phone number was almost certainly still good). As I stood off to the side, I could hear <span class="p3"></span> talking to a bunch of people about how she had had intimate relations with some guy, and presumably because she had gotten hooked, she had since then been entertaining an addiction much like my own. The tone was rather light-hearted. I wasn't sure how to feel about it then, and I still don't.
				</section>
				<section>
					I really messed up my relationship with <span class="p3"></span>. The only person I've ever felt closer to is <span class="p5"></span>, and that's just because I didn't make such an attempt to restrain myself as I did with <span class="p3"></span>. Moreover, I don't think there's <em>anyone</em> who I've gotten along with better. (I'm sure you've heard this all before.) <span class="p3"></span> is an exceptional person, and it pains me deeply that she's no longer in my life. I'm hoping that the website I made will help make things right, but there's no guaruntee of that, and I couldn't think much lesser of her for not being able to move on regardless. I guess only time will tell.

					In my attempt to find out where p6 lives, I stumbled across p12's house (who she's not related to). As it turns out, p12 lives in the same neighborhood as p5, if not the same street. (I don't remember exactly where p5 lives.) Moreover, he lives close enough to fairly easily walk to her house (based on my general knowledge of where it should be), and I surely passed by his house when going to p5's house. There must be more people I know who live nearby, but I still consider it pretty interesting.

					I finally started transferring my written journal onto this website yesterday. This has taken <em>way</em> too long. I got sick of waiting around for me to figure out how to make things just right, so I cut some corners, got to work on implementing it, and declared it good enough. There's still some stuff I need to add at some point, and there are a few things that I notice I need to refine when I'm transferring what I wrote, but I'm finally starting to make some progress (very slowly). I'm trying to clarify and expand things as I transfer them (while maintaining as much of the original content as I can), and it's already killing me. As is always the case, I have to find a balance between speed and thoroughness. It's not working very well so far. If you start looking at the dates of these entries, you'll notice that they aren't very sequential; my motivation to finish (or start) entries tends to drop off significantly once they lose their immediate relavence, and it creates a build-up that poses quite a challenge to tackle. Some of those entries are really important, and I'm not happy about putting them off. I'm not sure <span class="trigger">how long it will take me to get everything caught up<div><div>I'm shooting for finishing the transfer process before school starts and maybe catching things up by winter break.

					I finally made first contact. Close to a month ago when I first conceived of my plan to try to throw p6 a surprise birthday party, I always knew that there would be some obstacles to overcome, but I never imagined that getting in touch with her parents would be such torture. As I devised a course of action, my first thought was to use my still undeleted Facebook account to message p6's parents. (It also occurred to me that I continue finding uses for my Facebook account; maybe I should reevaluate deleting it.) Conveniently, p6 had a number of family members listed on her account, so it was rather trivial to find her parents and send them a message. (<span class="p13">Her mom</span> was the only one I expected to reply since it turned out that her dad's account was maintained by her mom.) After waiting a reasonable amount of time, I decided that p6's mom didn't check her Facebook account often enough to to be reliably contacted that way, so I tried a few other family members from p6's list. Again, it seemed that they too couldn't be expected to see my message in time. Far from hopeless, I scoured the Internet searching for alternative means of contact; afterall, the Internet knows everything. The most success came from the Whitepages: I found some home phone numbers and <span class="elaborate discreet">an address that was plainly wrong</span><aside data-heading="Explanation" data-revisit="expand">It didn't go anywhere on my bus route.</aside>. It didn't take long to find out that the phone numbers were just as useless as the address. I figured the best thing to do was to go through the rest of the family members on p6's Facebook account. Sadly, it seems that the majority of p6's family is social invalids. Going back to the Whitepages, I searched for information on the rest of her family members. I got a few results, but none of them panned out either. At this point, I was starting to get desperate: I was running out of things to try, and p6's birthday was a little over a week away. I was beginning to consider the possibility of taking the surprise away and directly confronting p6. I wasn't about to give up yet, though. I thought about messaging basically all of p6's parent's friends on Facebook, but that seemed like a drastic step, and I wasn't sure what the turn-around time on that would be. Thinking back to the Whitepages, I remembered that, if you were a premium member, you could get access to things like cell phone numbers, but I had waived that opportunity since "premium" always means "pay money". However, desperate times call for desperate measures; I was going to look into it. As it would just so happen, there's an option for a one-time payment for one person's information. I chose p6's mom and reluctantly parted with $<span data-currency="USD">9.99</span>. With this newfound information, I began making my way through the 10 phone numbers listed. I tried something like 6 of the most promising ones and <em>none</em> of them were valid. Along with the phone numbers, though I recieved a bunch of other information including addresses. Although there were countless addresses, one stood out to me due to its position along my bus route. More than that, it stood out to me because it was within walking distance of my old house. I have a lot to say about this, but to stay on track with this story, I'll hide it in a separate section <span class="elaborate discreet">here</span><aside data-heading="Rant">Let's take a moment to really drive home what I just said: <em>p6 lives within walking distance of my old house.</em> That means that, <strong>for the whole time that I knew her</strong>, one of my closest friends has only been separated from me by maybe a 10-minute walk. <strong>For the whole time that I knew p6</strong>, instead of quietly sitting alone in my house (more or less), I could have been getting to know a person who I never felt I got to spend enough time with; instead of playing a videogame with an extra controller in order to trick it into showing me what the two-player functionality was like, there could have actually been two players; instead of jogging down the driveway and around the well house to get exercise, I could have jogged down to p6's house. Having this information could have completely changed how I spent my time outside of school. p6's desire to keep me from knowing which bus stop she got off at sabotaged my chances of getting to know her outside of school. If that's not bad enough, she <em>knew</em> that I lived that close: she knew what bus stop I got on at, so she knew that there was a distinct possibility that I could walk to her house, and yet she <em>still</em> kept it to herself (<span class="h2">or maybe that's why she didn't say anything</span>). Worse yet, mainly due to my stellar fund-raising efforts, <strong>I have literally walked by her house countless times and even gone so far as to <em>KNOCK ON THE DOOR</em></strong>! Although my main memory of her house is that no one ever answered, I've been around it so often that I could recognize all of her neighbors; I could almost map out her part of the neighborhood by memory; I could tell her anecdotes about the people surrounding her and how my family almost moved into the house <strong><em>right across the street</em></strong>! I remember one time when I told p6 how she should show more initiative with her fund raisers and venture out into her neighborhood; I suppose it's good that she didn't because it would have taken away from my business. p6 could have lived anywhere else and, although fairly close, it would still take some effort to visit her. But no: she lived so close to me that, had she lived a few more houses down the street, <strong>she would have used the same bus stop as me</strong>! p15 thought he was jealous when he found out that p6 rode my bus; just think of how he'd feel knowing that p6 could have made regular visits to my house. I had always gotten the impression that p6 used one of the earlier bus stops before my stop: after all, no one can live that close to someone without them knowing about it, right? WRONG! I've been running laps in front of her house for years without ever knowing it. For all of the band camps, all of the concerts, all of summer school, we've gone to and from basically the same places. Remember when I graduated and I was lamenting the separation from my friends? That could have been solved in short order. Remember when I didn't want to take a special trip to p6's house because I didn't want my dad to make something of it? Throw that out the window: being able to walk there changes everything. <span class="h5">I really think that I would have started making frequent visits to p6's house if I had known that she lived so close to me</span>; she's a nice person, and I really liked being around her... But now I don't live near her. Now I can't take a stroll down the street and say "hi" to a good friend; now I can't find relief from my isolation; now I can't learn what's going on in p6's life beyond our brief encounters. <span class="e23">My efforts to circumvent her aversion to telling me where she lived came 6 months too late.</span></aside>; I strongly encourage reading it, especially if you're p6. Aside from my other thoughts on the nearness of her house, though, I saw it as an opportunity to close the separation between me and p6's parents. As luck would have it, my parents wanted to do some stuff at the old house yesterday. (As luck would also have it, the itch of my chigger bites had pretty much dissapated by that time, so I was more mobile.) In anticipation of the trip (and during the trip), I wrote a letter for p6's parents and put it in a letter, so I could put it in their mailbox. When I had the opportunity at the other house, I asked to go down to the mailbox (which is pretty far away) with the ploy of making measurements for a mailbox indicator. Although I did make measurements of the mailbox in order to keep myself honest, I also made a quick detour to p6's house to deliver my letter. Today, I got a call from p6's mom. <span class="e66">Victory!</span>

					p6's mom calling me was the high point of my day, but there have been complications since then. (Doesn't the universe know that I don't like rollercoaster rides?) Starting with the conversation, p6's mom seemed totally on board with the idea and, thankfully, wasn't at all concerned with the fact that a guy was trying to do something nice for her single daughter. <span class="p13">She</span> wondered what sort of things I had in mind (not much) and offered some ideas of her own (also not much). In the end, we basically decided to think things over, contact some people, and talk tomorrow. Later in the day, I got a text from <span class="p0">one of p6's friends</span> (I can take a guess at who it is, but they didn't say) who discouraged me from putting together a party since they didn't think p6 would want one. (In the process, I was reminded of why I didn't want to do anything too extravagant.) <span class="elaborate">Future.</span><aside data-heading="Confusion" data-revisit="date:10/28/2018">Now that I think about it, how did they get my phone number?</aside> p6's friend thought getting some of her friends together might be okay, though. Eventually, I got in touch with p14, and she told me the same thing. As I considered the situation, though, I discovered that I had a problem: it's not too difficult to make up for a lack of extravagence by adding more people, but given the timeframe, I don't think many people will be able to show up. <span class="elaborate discreet">I have a hard time understanding why someone wouldn't want a party thrown for them</span><aside data-revisit="fill"></aside>, but if I try to prevent myself from diverging from that sentiment too far, <span class="e-2">I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to do much of anything</span>. Despite that, however, I'm not about to let all of my hard work go to waste; if nothing else, I want to see p6 on her birthday and give her at least a small gift. Forget decorations; forget a cake; forget other people; I don't want to lose my one chance to see a person I haven't seen in nearly 2 years. She would surely still be happily surprised even if I showed up on my own. I know I've avoided visiting my friends one-on-one because of what my dad might think and say, but I've invested way too much time and energy into this. I might be able to come up with some way of avoiding the full force of his lectures, but if I can't, so be it: I'm not letting this opportunity slip through my fingers. I'm not sure what the next conversation with p6's mom will bring, but I do know one thing: it will bring me to p6.

					Life is so unfair: <span class="e33">I spent nearly a month trying to put something together for p6, and it was all for nothing.</span> Particularly since my last entry, I've been suspecting that things wouldn't work out as great as I had imagined, but as I said, I was going to at least visit p6 and give her something on her birthday (today). But no: apparently even that was asking too much. After not getting a second phone call on Friday, I tried to keep up with things with a painfully slow-moving conversation via text. It wasn't until yesterday that it was finally decided that no one was really going to show up, and I expressed my desire to show up anyway. p6's mom seemed more than willing to go ahead with that, but there were a few plans that we had to make sure that we didn't conflict with; she said she'd find out exactly when things were happening today. This morning, p6's mom said that her sister was going to surprise p6 with a shopping trip, so I had to wait until they got back before I could visit. Time went by; I made sure I hadn't been forgotten about; I started getting worried that I wouldn't have much time to visit. I knew that p6 was going to have a special dinner with her family followed by church, so I knew that my visit would have to end at about 6:00, and it was getting late. At around 4:00, I got a text from p6's mom saying that p6 had ended up going to <span class="p16">one of her friends</span>' house. I knew that p6 wouldn't be leaving her friend's house any time soon; I had lost my chance to see p6 on her birthday.

					I think it's safe to assume that p6's mom isn't going to inform me of another opportunity to see p6. If she was ever going to tell me anything, it would have been last weekend or at least Wednesday, but now another weekend is coming up, and I've still heard nothing. I was skeptical as I entered into the weekend before, but now it's just ridiculous to hold out hope. Speaking of the weekend, though, I recieved a text from p6 on Sunday responding to the last thing I said on her birthday. I told her how she was a little late, and after apologizing, she asked to call me. As I'm sure you're familiar with by now, I had my reservations about speaking to her out loud on the phone with my parents around. To compound the issue, my parents had been hovering around my room, so my chances of hiding away and holding a phone call without them noticing were quite slim. Given the bleak outlook for me being able to see p6 any time soon, I really wanted to at least talk to her, but I didn't know how I was going to make it work. <mark class="e22">To my great disappointment, I had to decline p6's offer.</mark> ... Just kidding: my desire to talk to her won out by a slim margin. Considering how this is the main thing I wanted to mention, I ordinarily would have started this entry out with something like, "I got to talk to p6 on Sunday," but then I wouldn't have been able to lead you to believe that I decided to take the infuriatingly reclusive course of action. I was really close to it, though; I just couldn't stand the idea of turning down a phone call from p6 yet again when I had been building up my hopes of so much more for so long before. <mark class="e65">I didn't regret it.</mark>

I don't want to completely skip over this, but it's not important enough to spend much time on especially considering how I plan on talking about the band performance in two days.

					I need to change how I do things with this journal.

					Yesterday was p5's birthday. Before your imagination starts running wild, no: my day didn't involve p5 at all. As a matter of fact, I would have typed this yesterday if I hadn't forgotten that I wanted to. The main point I want to make here is that I haven't forgotten about p5 (you know, except for yesterday). It's been over four years since we broke up, but I still think of her regularly, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Both good and bad, p5 has left a lasting impact on my life. The thing I wish I could change most, though, is that we reestablished our friendship. However, regardless of anything that transpired between us, I harbor no anger towards her. p5 still means a lot to me, and I wish her all the best.

					Remember how I keep saying I need to change how I do things with this journal? That time has come. Since the end of summer, I've been especially wanting get this journal on track, so I can at least not feel like I'm falling even further behind. I think the thing to do is to note the most important things of each day and then only write about them in monthly updates. As I'm sure even you can notice, the more recent something is, the more I feel compelled to elaborate on it. By putting things off a while, I'm giving myself time to stop caring about whatever thing I thought was critical to describing myself. Also, I'm going to make sure that I only go up to something like a week prior, so I don't start getting up to current events and sabotage my efforts. In order to prevent myself from sounding too boring and biographical, I'm still going to try to add entries at the time of the event when something especially important happens, but I think I'm going to have to put them after the recollection of the relavant month or do some sort of fancy integration because there will undoubtedly be things that I want to reference which you won't know about until I've made such a recollection.
				</section>
				<section>
					Keeping with my resolution to get this back on track, I'm going to go over the things that have happened to me since I've started keeping a daily log of my activities. Despite what I've just told you, I'm going to bring things all the way up to today (as opposed to stopping a week before I get to today) since I want to start with a clean slate. This wouldn't have been a problem if I had gotten to this right after the end of summer when my life was lame, but now I'm really going to have to work to make sure I don't get carried away with myself. I think some of it is fairly worth mentioning, though, so I don't feel too bad about it. (But then again, maybe I wouldn't feel the same way in a week or so.)

							I dug up some old things I wrote; in particular, my essay that I read at the Veterans Day assembly in 10<sup>th</sup> grade and an essay I wrote about the Jump Rope for Heart contest I won in elementary school. I was most intrigued by the second item since it was typed while I was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade (and therefore when the memory was much more recent), and although many details are similar or believable (if I don't remember), there are a few critical details which are completely different: I stated earlier how the jump roping contest came down to me and my primary rival, Trey. People started cheering my name (instead of his); I felt bad for him (but still enjoyed it); and I eventually came out on top. Well, according to Jumping to Victory, Trey got out unusually early; I eventually came out on top over <span class="p0">some random person</span>; and <em>some time afterwards</em> people started cheering my name. That's completely different! Moreover, that essay was written no more than a year and a half before I wrote the completely different version in this journal. And when I discuss my current version of events, it's not like I'm trying to recollect some faint memory that I have a general feeling about; I'm <em>certain</em> that things happened the way I remember them. It especially stuck with me how everyone was cheering my name instead of Trey's; that's not something people forget. There isn't the least bit of doubt in my mind that my recollection of those events is correct, but at the same time, how am I supposed to argue with myself? I've tried considering that I may have subconsciously condensed the most interesting Jump Rope for Heart stories from multiple years into one super awesome year, but I keep coming back to my vivid recollection of people cheering for me and me feeling bad for Trey: Trey and I were the last ones standing basically every year, so that could have been any time, but I have a hard time believing that people would have cheered for me on two different years. Not only do I consider it generally unlikely, but also, wouldn't <em>that</em> be something I'd remember? <span class="elaborate">Future.</span><aside data-heading="Reconsideration" data-revisit="date=10/5/2018">The more I think about it, the more I think people may have actually cheered for me on two separate years, and during the second time, I was thinking how everyone must have been pretty desperate to cheer.

More exactly, my dad agreed to start the process of closing on the house; we still owned it for a little while and we needed to get all of our stuff out (which was quite a mountain-full).

On a different note (mainly because I'm worried that I won't mention it earlier), it seems that my dad has developed a fairly close relationship with our neighbor's adult daughters (who are a little older than me).

In other news, I finished reworking my super awesome, basically indecipherable code. Maybe one day I'll name it. In further different news, this was the day of the last trip of hauling stuff out of the old house.

							While I was trying to go up a super steep hill at a brisk pace to get to my class quickly, I noticed a few signs encouraging the brave soul who decided to make the trek. When I got to the top, there were a few people standing by to congratulate me and give me lemonade. I took the congratulations but not the lemonade since I was in a hurry and I don't like lemonade anyway. Later in the day in one of my classes, I noticed that the class was going to be centered around basically exactly what it would take to carry out an experiment I had been wanting to do (putting a certain unit of DNA into a bacterium which would cause it to make a certain enzyme that's useful in copying a sample of DNA). Inspired, I probed around and floated my idea to <span class="p0">the professor</span>. They didn't seem very interested at all.

In case you were expecting this to be an explanation of why I think the girl is gorgeous, I'll tell you that you were mistaken, but you can find a very thorough account of qualities that I prefer <a href="/journal/extracontent/girls/appearance">here</a>. Don't get me wrong, I'm more than capable of providing an exceptionally detailed description of exactly what makes her so beautiful and what sort of feelings that instills in me, but I generally consider myself to project some degree of professionallity and control which helps people take me seriously and trust me, and I'd like to keep those impressions at least somewhat maintained. Besides, delving into that too deeply would chip away at the mental barriers I've established to prevent myself from getting too carried away (not that typing this has done me any favors).</aside> Ordinarily, I wouldn't have mentioned it, but given that most people are more or less settled in by the second class, I couldn't help but notice certain irregularities: For one thing, she doesn't seem to have any friends in the class. More than that, there just so happens to be a seat open right next to her (which is one of very few total open seats). Even more than that, while everyone else was dead to the world looking at their phones, she was casually looking around the room waiting for class to start. As if that's not enough, when she introduced herself during the first class, she seemed rather soft-spoken (which I often consider cute) and I'm pretty sure she was majoring in something at least mildly similar to biology (which is always a plus). In other circumstances, I'd be careful to make sure that I'm not giving preferential treatment to anyone, but everything is making it so easy; she's just begging me to go over there. Just to be clear, I don't have a crush on her, that's only happened to me once and that will be the only time if I can help it; however, if that girl is feeling lonely in class, I strongly suspect that she's going to find herself with a new friend very soon.

There are few things more attractive than a girl who knows her elements. I wonder if I'll see her after class tomorrow (the next time I have the class).

					Today was the first meeting of the Biology Club<note-><div><div>I can't make up my mind whether I should capitalize "biology club" since it's such a generic name, but at the same time, it's kind-of being used as a proper noun.</div></div></note->. Considering how my whole day has centered around the Biology Club and I still have a respectable amount of homework due tomorrow, I don't have much time to dwell on this (there's a shocker), but I think you can agree that this is an event that deserves some mention. Since I'm not likely to say it before this, the reason the meeting was today is because there's a time slot between 12:00 and 1:30 when the university doesn't plan any classes. Naturally, I'd like to make the first meeting be one that everyone can attend, so I planned it on a Wednesday at 12:00 when I'd be prepared. Naturally again, however, other people have the same idea which can force people to pick which club they want to go to. I thought I had lucked out and gotten a time that didn't conflict with the clubs that people interested in a biology club might also be interested in; however, as I noticed earlier today, the Student Medical Society planned their [first?] meeting in the same time slot as mine. I instantly knew that I lost a large fraction of my potential members. Hopefully, I'll be able to make it so that future meetings don't conflict with that or any other relavant clubs; then maybe I'll be able to regain some of that fraction.
				</section>
				<section>
					The meeting itself went pretty well. I was worried that my subconscious nerves would make it difficult for me to get through the meeting, but aside from a little stiffness and forgetting a few of the things I wanted to say, things seemed to go pretty smoothly. It was strange walking into the room because you could have sworn that everyone was waiting around for a class to start and I was the teacher. I would have prefered to have arrived early, but I misjudged how long it would take me to get my laundry going, so I ended up sliding in at the last minute. Consistent with the environment of a classroom, there were a lot of blank stares, but I got a few reactions out of some people, and I'd like to assume that the other people were having a good time on the inside (or at least as much of a good time as you can have at an informational meeting). Something I found surprising was that Dr. Taylor wasn't there: I thought for sure he'd be there especially since it was the first meeting and there are no classes going on at the time. <span class="h2">I guess he figured I'd do great no matter what, so he wouldn't show up and cramp my style.</span> Another person who wasn't there was a member of the old biology club who's basically the only person who still participates in the SEMO Biology Club Facebook group and, moreover, still goes to SEMO. As it turns out, she's president of the Student Medical Society.
				</section>
				<section>
					Something that didn't go quite as planned was getting everyone to fill out a survey to help me figure out how to plan things; namely, there was no survey for them to fill out. Although I had finished the survey last night, I didn't send it to Dr. Taylor until after my early classes this morning since I was worried that I had overlooked something important in my effort to hurry to get it finished; I plainly didn't give him enough time to get them printed up. To make up for it, I got out a piece of paper for people to pass around and write their emails on. When I got it back, I should have asked if everyone got it, but I'm pretty sure they did.<note-><div><div>I had done a quick count of the people present, and it was actually less than the number of emails I got.</div></div></note-> There were 22 emails, over &frac23; of which were from girls (which parallels the ratio in the majority of my classes).<span class="elaborate" data-revisit="date = 10/2/2018">Future</span><aside data-heading="Correction">I found out later that at least one girl was there and "forgot" to put their email.</aside> As it turns out, there actually were a lot of important things I had overlooked in my survey, so I suppose people not getting the first version worked out for the best. I emailed everyone with the revised survey.
				</section>
				<section>
					When I was finished with my primary presentation, I gave people the opportunity to leave but invited them to stay to watch an awesome biology-related music video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k99bMtg4zRk">A Capella Science's CRISPR Cas9</a>). Some losers left but most people stayed, and I think they approved of my selection. I also ended up showing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWU0bfo-bSY">squirrel obstacle course</a>. I didn't end up showing the Facebook group, but they can figure that out. In the end, three people stayed behind to discuss all things biology club. (Technically, 5 people stayed behind, but two of them left the room before the music video and then wandered around outside the room until I came out, which begs the question, "Why did they leave in the first place?") Maybe I can get them to help me with some stuff because doing everything myself is killing me: I'm not quite to a Boston University level of sleep yet, but I'm well on my way; I need to spread out some responsibility. After we talked awhile, I went to the first meeting (this year) of the robotics club. They seemed happy to have a biology major join them, and they eventually got something to roll around on the ground.

					Today I confronted the girl who has been acting like she knows me. As I sat in the dining hall minding my own business, who should come by but that mystery girl. Once again, she shyly smiled at me and waved, and I was reminded of how I had no idea who she was. As she walked away, I was thinking how I couldn't let this keep going on. I tossed it around in my mind for a while, but eventually, I decided that I was going to go sit with her and her friends, so I could actually get to know her. Luckily, they were sitting nearby, so I wouldn't feel too uncomfortable leaving some of my stuff behind which would be too bulky to take with me. I took my plate and drink, pretended like I had somewhere to go in the opposite direction, looped around, and headed for her table. As I approached, the girl saw me and gave me that shy smile routine again, undoubtedly under the impression that I was just passing by. Much to her and her friends' surprise, I sat right next to her and said something along the lines of, "Hello... Who are you?" It turns out that her name is Priya.
				</section>
				<section>
					Over the course of my time at the table, I had a chance to uncover some information about Priya. Foremost of the things I wanted to know was whether we actually knew each other before. In direct contrast to "I think [we know each other]", she admitted that we really don't know each other at all. Apparently, she just saw me and wanted to say "hi" or some other lame excuse like that, and we didn't have any other connection before that. I asked her whether she pretended like she knew people often, and she said that this was her first time. Later on, she was telling me how she was generally bored, so I told her how that must inspire her to start staring at people.<note-><div><div>She never actually stared at me much, though (that I noticed).</div></div></note-> At one point, she asked me whether I had a SnapChat account, and after being disappointed, she took a short video of me to share with her friends, presumably on SnapChat. Other things I learned about Priya include: she's a freshman; she lives on the 9<sup>th</sup> floor of Towers South; she's majoring in computer science; and she thinks I look like Ron Weasley (which she somehow tried to relate to how she told me that she thinks we know each other). I wanted to ask what country she was from, but I didn't want to presume she was from another country, especially since she didn't really have an accent. (She's totally from another country, though.) By the way, she was plainly embarrassed throughout all of this.
				</section>
				<section>
					After a fairly short period of time, Priya and her friends finished eating and decided to leave. As they left, I got a phone call from Jon. When I answered, he told me how he heard that I was hanging out with a bunch of girls. (By the way, I saw him leave the dining hall before I went to sit with Priya and her friends.) After making some jokes, he told me to meet him in the Towers South lobby when I was finished eating. Eventually, I finished eating and proceeded to the lobby. When I arrived, I was surprised to find not only Jon and some random people but also Priya and her friends. Once she saw me, Priya rhetorically asked whether I was following her now. Apparently, Jon knows Priya and her friends, and it was because he was with one of her other friends that he saw the video of me on SnapChat and knew that I was "hanging out with a bunch of girls." When will I stop being surprised that Jon knows everyone? Anyway, Jon and I talked some while everyone else was playing pool and listening to the music one of them was playing through a speaker. It seemed like it would be fun to stay, but I value sleep and finishing homework, so soon enough, I had to make my departure. Too bad I haven't accomplished much in terms of getting sleep and finishing homework.
				</section>
				<section>
					In case you're interested, another event of interest today was that, after nearly two weeks of waiting, I finally got the bioluminescent algae from the professor who had it. Hopefully, I can get it to glow for the Biology Club meeting tomorrow (because it's sure not doing anything now). Another thing that happened is someone throwing up in the hallway. Unlike some people, they actually made an effort to clean it up, and they were grateful when I found a janitor for them. If you prefer to end with something less gross, I can tell you that there was a new puzzle today which I made decent progress on. Also, it's Tess' birthday today, but I didn't see her to tell her "happy birthday."

				<section>
					Priya most definitely has a crush on me. As I've said, I've been pretty suspicious of Priya for a while now, but she finally passed the threshold I set for what it takes for me to be sure. While I was getting my food at lunch today, I happened to encounter Priya and her two main friends. As usual, I was enthusiastically greeted, and having just arrived at the dining hall, they proceeded to gather food and find a place to sit. Since I hadn't sat down yet, and I secretly like sitting with enthusiastic people, I made a few extra laps around the dining hall in an effort to stall while they settled in. Once the time seemed right, I took a trip right past their table, and wouldn't you know it; they invited me to sit with them. After acting like I wasn't sure whether I'd take them up on their offer, I obliged. It was during this meal that I became sure of Priya's thoughts about me.
				</section>
				<section>
					Without wasting much time, Priya and her friends began subjecting me to a barrage of questions. One of the earlier questions especially caught my attention, though: "Do you have a girlfriend?" Care to guess who asked that one? I said how I found it interesting that she (Priya) would ask that question, to which her friends laughed and Priya told me, "Just answer the question!" I considered not saying anything, but I wanted to see what her response would be, so I informed her of my availablity. Conveniently, Priya then began lamenting her lack of a boyfriend. Now, I may be able to come up with some way that a person might randomly start acting like they know someone; I may be able to dismiss a display of fairly intense interest; I might even be able to imagine that a person is poking me and wiggling their eyebrows as a joke; but when you put all of that together along with a blatantly obvious attempt to establish that we're both single, there's just no getting around the fact that Priya is crushing on me big-time. Moreover, she surely knows that I know what she's thinking, but she really doesn't seem to care at all. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around how someone can be that bold about their feelings about another person when I've never seen anything like that before. I've had a number of girls act extra-interested in me, but I generally considered it just that: acting. I've also had girls who were actually interested in me but who tried to be at least a little subtle. (The ones I know of are Caitlyn and Kim.) However, blatant legitimate flirting like that is only something I've ever seen occasionally on TV (assuming Emma never actually had a crush on me). I pretty much figured that such behavior didn't really exist or at least that my personality didn't attract the people who would do that. It seems that I was mistaken. It especially gets me how, not only did Priya ask whether I had a girlfriend and tell me that she didn't have a boyfriend, but she also went out of her way to seem especially pouty when addressing her relationship status, and she made sure that there could be no doubt about the link between my answer and her statement by making sure that she immediately lead into her predicament; she wanted to make it <em>extremely</em> clear what she was hoping for. I didn't expect her to be so direct (without actually being direct); it's a rather strange approach. Another thing I find strange is how she can possibly have a crush on me when we know essentially nothing about each other: Maybe we're getting to know each other a little <em>now</em>, but that doesn't explain the past, and we've still had very few interactions beyond just seeing each other in passing. Priya having a crush on me with so little information to go on makes about as much sense as someone picking someone else out at random, eating brunch with them on two separate occasions, and then suddenly becoming so caught up in the person that they try to plan the time and place of their meals in order to optimize their chances of an encounter. <span class="t0">Oh wait...</span>
				</section>
				<section>
					At this point, you may be wondering how I feel about Priya. Although I don't share the intensity of her desire to be with me, I can't help but be drawn to someone who's so interested in me. Besides that, she's plenty friendly (of course), and she can keep a conversation going, so that's nice. Beyond that, I know very little about her: I have very little information on her interests; my primary knowledge of her interactions with people is of what she does when she really wants to go out with someone; I don't know what she wants to do with her life; I don't know how she handles disagreements; I don't know what her family life is like; I don't really know much of anything. I sure know that she doesn't have a boyfriend, though. As I've surely said many times before, I don't want to make a commitment to anyone without having a high degree of certainty that the relationship has the potential to last indefinitely; with so little information about her, it's hard for me to say whether Priya qualifies. Perhaps more importantly is the fact that she's from another country: Once one of us leaves this university (I don't even know who would be first since I don't know whether she's a regular or exchange student), there will be very little opportunity for contact, and that's just setting things up for disaster. I suppose there's the possibility that she has some kind of frequent association with this country, but I wouldn't count on that, and I know I won't be going to Nepal any time soon. Regardless of whether Priya turned out to be someone I'd like to pursue a relationship with, I'm skeptical of the chances of things working out.
				</section>
				<section>
					So the question now is, "What am I going to do about this?" As long as I'm careful about not leading Priya on, I don't really feel the need to do anything: It's not like I'm being stalked; I don't have a girlfriend to get jealous; and who doesn't like an admirer? I don't see a problem here. However, I really do need to be careful about not leading Priya on. She probably has some idea that I'm not ready to dive into a relationship (given the circumstances) since she has made her intentions abundantly clear, and I haven't responded to them, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult for her to forget about that if I gave her a reason to. Another thing to worry about is Priya directly asking me out. Although I doubt it would be the end of the world, I don't want to have to get in to all of this, and chances are, she wouldn't find my points very convincing anyway. There's always the possibility that such a confrontation is inevitable, but I think I can decrease the likelihood of it happening if I never address her crush directly, even in joking. A borderline example happened at lunch today: While Priya was trying to leave because she had something to do, <span data-revisit="Maddie Brown">one of her friends</span> was still trying to finish eating (or maybe it was drinking). After insistantly being prompted to leave, I told her that she should let Priya leave, so we could hang out and make her jealous.<note-><div><div>Her friend even responded with, "True."</div></div></note-> To that, Priya asked why I was trying to make her jealous and yet again moved her eyebrows up and down at me. I never explicitly mentioned Priya's crush on me, but making veiled references to it like that could prove problematic if I do it too often. Also, there's the chance that Priya interpreted what I said as a suggestion of interest in her. I need to watch myself.

					I'm such a sneak. A week ago today, I was going to dinner when I saw Priya's friends in the study lounge again. We waved at each other, and since they're never parted from each other, I figured that Priya must have been temporarily occupied elsewhere. I ate dinner, and when I came back by, only a few people I didn't recognize were left in the study lounge, but Priya's friends' stuff (and surely hers) was still there, so they must have been planning on coming back. As I headed back to my room, a solution to a problem began forming in my mind: Although I didn't want to reinforce Priya's crush, the idea of spending a larger amount of time with her wasn't especially unappealing. Since we don't cross paths too often, the only feasible way of making that a reality would be establishing a means of contact to serve as a point of coordination, but any direct request or obvious display of interest would certainly put me in dangerous waters. If only there were some way of exchanging phone numbers without arousing suspicion... After thoroughly debating the plan in my mind, I began to put it into action: I took a fourth of a notecard and began writing my phone number on it. To cover my tracks, I made sure to write some of the numbers a little differently and format the phone number in a way that I wouldn't normally. I took a quick trip to the study lounge and found it the same as I had seen before. In a calm yet efficient manner, I placed the piece of notecard with my phone number on it in a noticeable location near what I assumed to be Priya's stuff and quickly made my exit. Upon examination of the hallway for recognizable witnesses, my successful escape was confirmed. About an hour after returning to my room, I received a strange phone call from a Florida phone number: Interestingly, they immediately asked me who I was; however, being the one who received the phone call, I felt entitled to figuring out who they were first. We went back and fourth for a while, and eventually, I gave in and told them who I was. For some reason, there was a large amount of laughing on the other line. With that, the stranger nearly hung up on me, but I insisted on finding out who they were. It was Priya; can you believe that? When I asked how she managed to get my number, she told me some crazy story about finding it laying on a table. After that, she apologized for disturbing me and hung up. ... Victory!

					Admittedly, I've been thinking a lot about my recent determination of Priya's feelings towards me. I've been waiting for the intensity of the feelings to return before I write about it, but especially since the later part of last school year, I've been really wanting a girlfriend. Without spoiling all of what I might say in a future entry, I'll tell you that, contrary to the usual reasons people want girlfriends, my motivation stems from my desire for the type of close companionship that can most easily (and most acceptably) be derived from a romantic relationship. Although my initial reaction was one of objective intrigue, my desire for a girlfriend has quickly morphed it into something to be given serious consideration. It would be <strong><em>so</em></strong> easy for me to give in to Priya; it's an exceptionally tempting situation. However, that being said, I can't ignore the challenges I've identified with such a relationship. It's very likely that our contact with each other will end with our time in college, and I don't even know whether our personalities and interests are compatible with each other. I realize that many if not most people wouldn't consider those to be valid reasons, but besides that fact that I just wouldn't feel right getting into a relationship with no future, there's also the point that, if I'm already involved in a relationship, I'll be preventing myself from getting closer to people who there may be true potential with. Additionally, I've been trying to think of how to phrase my rebuttal to the not-knowing-her-well-enough part, and I think I finally have it:
				</section>
				<ul class="t0">
					<li>
						It's not fair to the other person if I always keep some distance between us.
					</li>
					<li>
						I'll always be holding back until I know there's a negligible chance of them abandoning me.
					</li>
					<li>
						I can't be sure they won't abandon me until they know all the important things about me.
					</li>
					<li>
						I need to trust a person a whole lot before I'm comfortable revealing some things.
					</li>
					<li>
						My trust is earned over a long period of time after getting to know a person very well.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					As such, despite my desire to have a girlfriend and Priya's obvious willingness to fill that position, I'm worried that indulging her (and myself) would lead me down a path that does more harm than good.

					In other news, Jon drove me home for Thanksgiving break. Although I could talk about a number of things such as how I didn't realize I needed to tell him I was ready to leave (unlike previous times) which allowed me to have a rather relaxed period of time after finishing packing, the thing I'm going to focus on is a conversation during the trip involving Priya. For a significant part of the car ride, I didn't bring Priya up because I didn't want to seem overly anxious, but eventually I mentioned the "interesting phone call" I received. I promptly followed it up with an inquiry of his knowledge of the event (as a gentle accusation). Naturally, he knew nothing about it, but I tried to seem at least a little suspicious since <span class="elaborate discreet">he would be the prime suspect</span><aside><ul><li>He knows my phone number.</li><li>He knows Priya.</li><li>He likes messing with me at every possible opportunity.</li><li>He thinks I should get a girlfriend.</li></ul></aside> if I didn't stage the whole thing. Although I couldn't be certain, I got this strange impression that Jon suspected me of something: I'm not sure if he was calculating the odds of me sneaking my phone number to Priya like that or if he was contemplating my true feelings of the event or what, but it seemed to me that his mind was hard at work. Not too long later, I worked in how Priya has a massive crush on me. Much to my surprise, rather than blindly accepting it and proceeding to tease me about it, he asked me how I could be sure. Even though he seemed relatively satisfied with my reasoning for why I know Priya has a crush on me, his satisfaction quickly plummeted when it came to explaining why I'm not going out with her. When the conversation had mostly died down, Jon told me how he knew "that Priya stuff" had been on my mind for a while. Before I had a chance to pretend like he was being ridiculous, he also added how he didn't want to hear a number of uncannily accurate flimsy deflections that I typically use. That didn't stop me from using a different one, though. I'd like to state for the record, though, that my flimsy deflections aren't all that flimsy, especially when accompanied by reinforcing facial expressions and tone of voice. It seems, however, that I need to come up with an even better cover when talking Jon now. I remember back in the good old days when, any time Jon asked me something I didn't want to answer, I could just stare at him, act like he was being ridiculous, and he would move on; now I stare at him, act like he's being ridiculous, and he calls my bluff. Not cool, Jon. Not cool.

					Last night, I had a dream about Claire. In between a bunch of other random science-related stuff, we had friendly conversation and worked together on a variety of things. At one point, Claire semi-abruptly walked out of a building I was in, and I followed her. When I caught up with her, she looked torn, and she told me how she had found the link to this journal and read it (implying that she read about my addiction even though, in the real world, there's not much to read about at this point in time). I was extremely worried about what would happen next, but I tried to not freak out, and I let her have her space as I went back to doing whatever I was doing (at that time, I think it was organizing an event). Later on, I saw Claire come back to do her share of some of the work, but I couldn't tell what she thought of me since she was busy and kind-of far away. Eventually, however, Claire came over to me and, although seemingly still trying to process what she had found out, she told me how she hadn't left me. Since I hadn't yet recovered from my panic attack, I didn't say much, but I thought how, after I calmed down some, I'd very much like to give her a hug... I just hope the real world isn't too different.

					This is the last full day before I go back to college. Yesterday, a massive snow storm came through putting down 8 or so inches of snow. As a result, my dad and I spent essentially the whole day shoveling snow. Although it's nice to have help with a large amount of manual labor, I'd rather do the whole thing myself than work with my dad. Consistant with every single other time I've ever worked with my dad, shoveling the driveway was misery. Before we even went outside, I had to battle over what to wear: My parents refuse to believe that I'm capable of determining what I need to wear to stay warm, so I was forced to put on extra layers. <aside></aside>Apparently, I'm so incapable of intelligent thought that I can't be trusted to know something as basic as whether my body is at a comfortable temperature. From there, I was subjected to a nearly constant barrage of critisism from my dad. For a significant portion of the hours we were out there, I had to listen to him tell me how I was using the wrong shoveling technique; I was throwing the snow in the wrong place; I was shoveling too slowly; I was shoveling obnoxiously fast; I was going to get sick because I unzipped my coat and took the hood off because I was burning up. As has always been the case, there was nothing I could do which was good enough in the eyes of my dad.

					As a disclaimer, I'm totally faking the emotion in what I'm about to type.<note-><div><div>Technically, I can psych myself up for it and get pretty close, but it's not natural.</div></div></note-> It's not that I didn't feel the emotion at one point; it's just that I don't feel it right now, and although my general policy in this case is to wait for the feeling to come back during a time when I'm more available to put things in this journal (as I've been doing), recent events have led me to believe that this lull could be permanent or at least very long-lasting. Since I don't think that this should be overlooked, I'm including it despite having shifted to a different mindset. Naturally, I could describe it in the past tense (which wouldn't require a disclaimer), but it just wouldn't be the same. For the record, it's quite rare that I finish even an intensely emotional entry in one day, and since the intensity of the emotion dissipates within a day or two, I'm faking the emotion for the rest of those entries as well; I bet you can't tell the difference. As another disclaimer, I'm not going to put the least bit of effort into finishing this entry today; I just want this date to precede the stuff that I really want to talk about (and I won't fake the date). Furthermore, I'm likely going to move this out of sequential order and into wherever I think it makes the most sense (which is surely where you're reading this now). If I'm faking the emotion, I might as well fake the order. For the time being, though, it's probably best if you pretended that I'm not faking the extent of my feelings because I really did feel this way, and I wouldn't want you to get confused in the context of the surrounding entries (although that probably already happened).<br>

					I <strong><em>really</em></strong> want a girlfriend. Just to be clear, this isn't inspired by the common motivation of finding someone to have a shared addiction with; I just really want the kind of close companionship that's most easily obtained from a girlfriend. It's been about 5 years since I was with Caitlyn, and although I wasn't too eager to jump right into another relationship at the time, I'm more than ready now. With starts and stops over time, I've been feeling this way since the second semester of last year. Though subtle and mainly observed within my mind, I've noticed changes in my thoughts and behavior: I've become significantly more likely to evaluate the appearances of girls and possibly treat them a little differently than I would normally; very often when talking to a girl, I'm silently gauging their compatibility with me; I could swear that I've been exhibiting a greater propensity for sitting with and conversing with girls instead of guys (but then again, I've been wondering about that for a long time); I've become rather unconcerned if my actions are perceived as flirting; I'm often plotting ways to spend more time with girls... Although there's a decent chance that I'm not giving my restraint enough credit, there are many times when I feel like I'm just barely preventing myself from professing my undying love to whoever I may be with at the time, especially if they're pretty and more so if I know them kind-of well. Depending on who I'm with, I may be having a casual friendly conversation with a girl, but in my head I'm thinking, "Wow, she's pretty." "I never want to stop talking with her." "How can I get her to meet up with me some other time?" "Come on, give me your phone number!" I feel like I've developed a kind of moderate insanity. I know there are plenty of guys out there (and surely girls as well) who would read this and be amused by my response to the kind of life they've embraced long ago, but I've come to expect some degree of rationality from my life, and it's disconcerting to have that thrown into question. At the same time, though, I'm typically not thinking about how disconcerting it is because I'm so overwhelmed by my exceptionally intense desire to have a girlfriend. It could be that my perception of the strength of the feeling is altered by my lack of experience with it, but regardless, the feeling is strong enough to occasionally inspire me to give serious consideration to the likelihood that I'll suddenly ask someone out without sufficient reason. What makes it worse is that there are quite a few girls who would almost certainly go out with me if I asked, and there are quite a few more who would likely be receptive to the idea if I turned up the charm for a little while. I can't do it, though: It's my responsibility to myself to make sure that a romantic relationship has an above average chance of success before I enter into it so any potential pain can be reduced. However, my conviction in that belief is faltering: Is the risk of potential pain really that high? Would I really have such a hard time bouncing back from a bad relationship? Is it really that bad to get into a relationship without knowing an excessive amount about that person? It has become an increasingly prevalent thought that I should decrease the requirements for people to become my girlfriend, and even if it doesn't work out, at least being in a short-lived relationship could take the edge off. This is aided by my reasoning that, as paranoid as I may be after what happened with Caitlyn and Sarah, it's still generally unlikely that such experiences will repeat themselves. As such, it's difficult for me to counter how badly I want a girlfriend. And I mean really, <em>really</em> want a girlfriend (as if you didn't understand that before). I just want a girlfriend so badly. I want someone's hand to hold; I want someone to cuddle up next to; I want someone I can tell anything to; I want someone I can flatter on a regular basis. I <em>really, really, <strong>really</strong></em> want a girlfriend <strong><em>SO</em></strong> badly. I want a girlfriend so badly.

					Once again, I find myself really wanting to talk about certain things but not having time to talk about it. Besides the fact that I think it's an important part of my life, writing in here is like my own little counseling session, and it gives me a place to relieve some of my desire to tell people things when I don't have anyone I can talk to. It's extremely frustrating to perpetually postpone talking about important life events in the interests of finishing homework or running some dumb errand. I'll have to come up with some other way addressing the most important things of my life because I'm sick of this.

					Aunt Violet died today. Although it's never a good thing when a person dies, we were never particularly close, and this isn't especially surprising, so I feel rather detached from the whole situation. Naturally, this doesn't bode well for the ongoing legal dispute, and I can only imagine how much yelling is going on right now. Regrettably, I wasn't able to contact my grandma before this, and with this new drama added to the mix, I don't know if and when I'll have another chance; I know I sure won't be visiting her with my parents. (There may be a chance at the funeral, but I would have to be extremely careful to ensure that it didn't seem like I was defying my parents.) Despite all of this, I find myself more concerned with the very real possibility that I won't be around to see Harper when she comes back for her stuff this weekend. It's hard for me to determine whether that's callous or whether it's just a natural response for someone who never developed a real connection with the person; I'd like to think that it's the second one, but it's not unlikely that people would think that I should have developed a connection by now. Regardless, I felt like this needed to be mentioned, and since it doesn't take nearly as long to type as the other stuff I've been wanting to include, here it is.

					It seems that Harper has a boyfriend now. Although I've never heard of this person before, apparently Harper met a guy on <a href="https://tinder.com/?lang=en">Tinder</a> moderately recently (a decent amount of time before she left SEMO), and just today, they've made things official. These events have inspired me to think about a number of things.
				</section>
				<section>
					The most obvious thing for me to address is what I think of Harper's new relationship. I only have a limited amount of information to work with, but overall, I'm not very concerned about it. When Harper first brought this guy up with me yesterday, it was in the context of her finding out that he might also be involved with someone else, so naturally, I had my reservations about him. To my great surprise, though, Harper found the whole situation laughable: She said how they had never said that they were exclusive, and she just wanted to get things cleared up. I told her about my differing views on what should happen in relationships, but I also told her how it didn't really matter as long as both of them were on the same page. Interestingly, Harper has no intention of marrying this guy (although she's open to marriage), but she'd like to have an exclusive relationship, so she can have some fun and learn something from the experience. As far as I can tell, the guy is sincere and shares Harper's relationship views. In case you're wondering, I really am fine with her being with someone else. Don't get me wrong: I care about her very deeply, and although I'll likely mention it before now, I've told her that I love her on two separate occasions (something which I won't take back), but at the same time, I recognize our differences, and I've been reluctant to encourage the idea of going out with her. Because of this, I can say with the utmost sincerity that, as long as this guy makes her happy, I think they should be together.
				</section>
				<section data-revisit="expand">
					That being said, I don't really understand why Harper is interested in this guy. Considering Tinder's method of matching people up, she surely finds him attractive, but even the most superficial people know that they can't base a relationship solely on appearance. I suppose whatever other similarities they share could make up for -----------------
				</section>
				<section data-revisit="expand">
					Something not as obvious for me to think about as a result of this (although significantly more pervasive) is the physical aspects of relationships, in particular, the most intimate of all physical acts. (As you should be able to see by the length of this paragraph, you should brace yourself.)

						To spare myself from needing to fill in the gaps later, I'll tell you that I'm planning a surprise birthday party for Harper. Soon after my let-down of a birthday, I began thinking of Harper (as I do regularly) and how she has been rather lonely since she returned home. Having birthdays already floating around in my head made it really easy to form the idea that it could be fun to throw Harper a surprise birthday party. Not only would it help cheer her up, but it would also give me a chance to see her. Besides that, it would give me a chance to redeem myself after my miserable failure of a birthday party for Hailey as well as more or less satisfy my desire to do for someone else what I appreciated so much myself. The fact that Harper's birthday is about two months away (May 9) reinforces the idea that I have enough time to pull this off, and the fact that I love her reinforces my motivation to make it a reality.

						I debated whether I should sacrifice even more sleep to write about something that's only mildly important, but I'd like to say something, and it just won't be the same if I mention it while reflecting on this time in my life.

						Although I could talk about a number of things today, the one I'm going to focus on is how I found out today that Kyra has a boyfriend. Maybe it's just me, but I find it rather strange that Kyra talks so much about one guy (me) if there's another guy who should be more important to her. I haven't had the opportunity to do so yet, but I plan on asking her in the very near future whether she actually does talk about her boyfriend a lot, and I just don't hear it because she's talking about me when I'm around. (Since I don't plan on making another entry for it, I'll include the future answer <span class="elaborate discreet">here</span><aside data-heading="Answer" data-date="2019/3/25">Apparently, Kyra does talk quite a bit about her boyfriend.</aside>.) If such was actually the case, it would make a little more sense, but it would still seem fairly strange. I know I've told you that I've had a number of girls act extra-interested in me, but I didn't necessarily believe that they really wanted to pursue a relationship with me. Kyra, however, (and pretty much Logan too) was bordering on a Priya-level of interest in me except that she replaced the flirty looks with nearly nonstop talking. Unlike Priya, though, I was never fully convinced that there was more to Kyra's interest in me than just her general quirky sociability (after all, it takes a <em>lot</em> for me to be fully convinced), but I had been getting pretty suspicious. I'm just glad that I found out now because I was just beginning to reinforce the idea that I may like to get a little extra close to her. If my dad were here, he would tell me that the fact that Kyra has a boyfriend shouldn't be used as evidence that she doesn't want to be with me, and I suppose that's somewhat possible even among my friends, but even if that's true, I'm not about to be the person who steals away someone's girlfriend. I have to admit, though, that I'm kind-of disappointed: Kyra has been really friendly to me, and as you know, I really, really, <em>really</em> want a girlfriend. It takes all the will-power I have to not go around flirting with every girl I know (and some I don't know). I want to be able to be that close to someone so badly, but it's my responsibility to myself and to others to maintain some degree of professionality with my interactions with people. Naturally, I don't mean that I can't ever loosen up around people, but I want people to view me as a dignified individual who goes about things carefully and thoughtfully; I don't want to be that guy who's obsessed with girls and will pull out all the stops to score a date. As long as I knew when to call it quits, I'm sure people wouldn't have a problem with me being that second person, but that's not who I want to be. Besides, I'm not quite sure if it's possible for me to flirt with someone without developing the corresponding feelings (which would be problematic for girls who are taken). I've always admired people who kept their composure regardless of the circumstances, so the idea of giving that up to more effectlively chase girls leaves me with a sickening feeling. I want a girlfriend so badly, though.
					</section>
					<section>
						But I'm getting off topic: It turns out that Kyra has a boyfriend, so now I have to reevaluate what her intense interest in me means and rein in whatever feelings I had been starting to develop for her. I don't want to distance myself from her because she's fun to be around, and she would surely be hurt by it anyway, but I'll have to be a lot more careful about how exactly I'm interacting with her from now on. I'm curious now, though, about whether Logan has a boyfriend; she's similarly hyper around me, and obviously, not hearing about a boyfriend is no indication of whether she has one or not. However, Logan doesn't go nearly as much out of her way to interact with me, and I think she derives a significant portion of her energy from Kyra. Then there's also Tess. And Harper. And any number of other girls who seem to like me. This girl stuff is driving me crazy. I remember back in the good old days when I would see people struggling with girl problems, and I would get annoyed by how much they stressed out about it, and I'd think how they needed to reorder their priorities. It's worth noting that I could understand the same kind of behavior for general friend problems, but the drama surrounding girls just made me sick to my stomach. I'd like to think that I don't quite fall into the category of people I was previously sickened by, but I'd be lying to myself if I didn't say that I would surely seem to be such a person at first glance. I try to take solace in the fact that these struggles reside almost exclusively in my mind and are quite difficult to observe in the real world. Moreover, I'd generally consider my problems to be more reminiscent of the general friend problems as opposed to the stereotypical girl problems experienced by those who pull out all the stops to score a date (and are upset if they fail), but it's not hard for me to see how that could be overlooked. For possibly a week or so now, I've been wanting to write some things about how I feel about Harper before I gave her the opportunity to read the partly unfinished, unlinked entries I've been trying to keep up with, and that might solve one girl problem, but the resolution isn't assured, and there's plenty more where that came from, anyway.

						Regardless of everything else going on, there's one problem I might be able to do something about: sleep. I could go on and on about this stuff all day long, but I have other stuff to do, the most pressing of which is sleep. I've been getting absolutely terrible sleep, and I have little hope that that will change any time soon, but I can at least get a slightly above average amount of sleep tonight (since the chance of a decent night's sleep is long gone). As you surely expected, I didn't do a very good job of getting through this quickly, and there's an endless list of more things I'd like to say, but I did get some of my feelings out, so it's not a total loss. For now, though, it's time to take one of those rare trips into my bed (after taking forever getting ready to do so).

						I really don't have time for this, but I want to at least mention it before it's too long ago: On Friday, I was invited to a frat party. You shold know by now that I'm generally not one to partake in such events, but <span class="p0">the person inviting me</span> wasn't too crazy, I've been kind-of curious about what they were like, and I'm all for excuses to spend time with people. However, it turned out that they weren't even planning on leaving until 10:00 pm, and besides the fact that I've been chronically sleep-deprived and I'd be a kill-joy regardless, my nose had developed a tendency to constantly stream snot. I don't like turning down invitations, but it didn't seem like a good idea to go. While I was expressing my reservations, they even offered another chance to spend time with them at the movies; however, they were suggesting a horror movie, and as I told them, I don't especially like horror movies <span class="elaborte">{explanation}</span><aside data-heading="Explanation">As I've likely said before regarding rollercoasters, I don't have a "fun" scared; there's just scared, not scared, and varying degrees in between. Although many people enjoy horror movies, I get legitimately scared watching them, so I don't find them very enjoyable.</aside>. That was actually the second time in two days that I had to turn down an invitation to spend time with someone: After the Biology Club meeting on Thursday (that I had the vice president, Kyra, run so they could get the experience), Kyra and Logan announced their plans to go to a place called Yummy Buffet, and invited everyone to come. It didn't seem like anyone was going to go, but they saw that I might like to go, so they especially prompted me to come. However, going out to eat somewhere else isn't paid-for like eating on campus, and worse yet, it turns out that the place focused on Asian food. I think I've established that I like spending time with Kyra and Logan, so I really liked the idea of going somewhere and eating with them, but it just didn't make any sense for me to go. I was rather upset by this because I really, really, <em>really</em> wanted to go with them. I like being around fun people, and increasingly as I seclude myself to work on homework, I'm lonely all the time, so I'd love to take people up on an offer to spend time with them, but I still have to be sensible. I know I could always be the one who invited people to hang out, and I could debate this point with you, but as I said at the beginning of this entry, I don't have time for this. The point is that I'm not happy about my missed opportunities to spend time with people. Why is it that I can resist something I want as much as spending time with people even though there are only a few fairly-convincing reasons whereas my addiction victimizes me regularly despite exceptionally persuasive reasons to prevent such an occurrence?

						On a side note, I was providing people with some helpful information about Harper's surprise birthday party yesterday when <span class="p0">someone</span> accidentally sent some texts to the group chat which were actually meant for a different group chat. As it turns out, that other group chat included Harper. At first, I just laughed it off, but then I realized that such a mistake could go in the other direction and alert Harper to what was going on. There's still more than a month left before the surprise party, and that's more than enough time for something like that to happen. Admittedly, other people don't say too much, and it isn't very likely that they send a text to the wrong place if it's been a while since anything was said in the group chat, but especially when there's a lot of activity because the day is getting close, I'm quite concerned about the secret leaking out. I told people today to try to avoid saying Harper's name or my name in addition to refraining from mentioning "surprise party" in the hopes that any misdirected text wouldn't be too suspicious. I suppose I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that everything works out.

						I think I figured out why desire for a girlfriend intensified last year around this time: warmer weather (and less-covering clothing). What has become of my life?

						This may come as a shock to you, but I don't have time to type this; I'm going to try anyway, though. I'm really worried that this is going to take up far too much time and leave me with (more) homework and sleeping problems.

						Although this isn't too necessary, I'll make a brief mention of how I spent some time with Kyra and Logan on Friday. We went to a novelty/surplus shop in town as well as the plant section of some other store that sold a bunch of stuff. Afterwards, despite the fact that it was hardly after 4:00, we went to get tacos for dinner. Besides the fact that I didn't have much money, I didn't order anything because only psychopaths and old people (<span class="h1">who are pretty much psychopaths</span>) eat dinner that early. I ended up eating a taco that Kyra couldn't eat, though. Throughout all of this, Kyra and Logan seemed to think that they had found the perfect person to set me up with: Steven (who's a girl despite the masculine name). I didn't do much to encourage them, but ... I didn't do much to <em>dis</em>courage them either. I was keenly aware, however, of the potential to prematurely lead this girl on if I went along with too obvious of an attempt to get us together. As Kyra drove us back, her favorite song, Be Bold Like Elijah, came on. (In case you forgot or I didn't mention it, her boyfriend's name is Elijah.)

						Yesterday (the main topic of interest) was a pretty interesting day as well. The plan for today was to go bowling with Kyra, Logan, and their friends, but it turned out that Logan first had to make an impulse buy of a puppy <span class="elaborate">elaboration</span><aside data-heading="Elaboration">Personally, I wouldn't consider the purchase of an animal to be something that should be done impulsively, but she (and Kyra) had been talking about getting pets for quite some time, and I actually think she'll take good care of it. Since dogs aren't allowed in their dorm, the puppy is apparently being stashed at Logan's sister's house, and she plans on making frequent visits.</aside>. Once all of that had been resolved late in the day, though, we did indeed go bowling. Although it sounded like more people might come, there were only two others: a girl named Mattie and Steven. (Steven's presence didn't come as a shock to me.) I found it rather convenient how Steven ended up in the middle back seat which necessitated me sitting next to her. Since I had established that I had essentially no money to spend, once we arrived at the bowling alley, Kyra paid for my admission. (She considered it her month-late birthday present to me.)

						I lied for the third time today. Yet again, I had finished next to nothing on a homework assignment (a small packet this time). I tried to fill out a little bit of it during class, but there was still essentially nothing done by the end. The professor began collecting the assignment, but it was kind-of disorderly, so it wasn't too noticeable when I didn't turn anything in. I knew a small amount of points was better than no points, and I was really conflicted on whether I should turn it in, but I decided to try to do a tiny bit of concentrated work on it after class and turn it in to the professor in their office soon after. I didn't get too much more finished, but it wasn't a very hard assignment, so I made a little progress. Before too much time had gone by for the mildly late turn-in to no longer seem innocent, I went to the professor's office (or, more exactly, their neighboring lab). I had intended to just quickly explain to them that I didn't end up getting the assignment to them, but it ended up coming out as that I <em>forgot</em> to get the assignment to them. I'm sure using the correct wording wouldn't have really changed the overall impression I portrayed, but if I try to justify some of the things I do as not lying by citing the exact wording, this incident can't be ignored. In this particular instance, though, I don't quite feel as bad as I might otherwise expect, likely because it was an accident, and I'm more concerned with how I once again dropped the ball on something I have essentially no excuses for not accomplishing. As you should know by now, I'm more than capable of launching into an extended discussion of this, but I'm much too tired to do so, and there's better ways of spending my time, anyway. There's actually something fairly significant that happened yesterday (and maybe you would count the day before), but I'm not going to write about it today.

						Although I'm reluctant to make anything of it, I found it interesting when I saw today that Tess hadn't gotten a haircut. I'm sure you don't understand the significance of that, but it becomes a rather intriguing observation when you take into account that it comes after 1. she had seemed very sure of getting a haircut, and 2. I told her that she looked prettier with longer hair. According to Tess, she didn't get her hair cut because her sister who cuts her hair wanted to dye her hair in addition to providing a haircut, so she decided to wait her out. Don't get me wrong: It's totally believable that something like that would happen by coincidence, and I've seen people do a whole lot more without actually being interested in a relationship, and I really am reluctant to make anything of it... but I can't help but find it interesting.

						Saturday was Harper's surpise birthday party. The day started off with me finishing up some origami decorations and gathering up the stuff I planned on bringing. As the time to leave approached, my parents started asking me some things about the party, and it soon leaked out that this surpise birthday party was for a girl and was organized by me. For reasons I can hardly begin to fathom, my dad didn't follow up the discovery of that information with an hour-long lecture about how I need a girlfriend and she seems like a good option (despite not knowing her at all). It was at this time that I also mentioned that I would tell my parents if I got a girlfriend, but they didn't seem to believe me, and they'll likely forget about it soon enough like they did last time. Something else that happened soon before the party is Delilah bailing on me! She gave me <span class="h1">some excuse</span> about her being "sick" or something and then I was left to be the only person at the party who knew Harper from college which is especially rough when I don't know any of Harper's other friends there (not to mention the fact that I was going to be the only guy there regardless). How could she do that to me?!

						Yesterday I got my wisdom teeth taken out. For quite some time now, the dentists have been telling me that I'm going to need to have my wisdom teeth taken out. For reasons I fail to understand, my parents have been resisting allowing me to get them removed until they start hurting; it would seem to me that it would make more sense to have the procedure while things didn't hurt and get it over with rather than wait until I'm in pain for an extended period of time and then follow through. Nevertheless, my mom eventually caved to the pressure from the dentists and decided to have things done this summer. I was never very concerned with any of this, but my mom was oddly worried the whole time. My dad hardly paid attention to what was going on, as usual. The day finally came yesterday, and as is often the case, I wasn't really nervous until right beforehand. As I sat in the chair getting prepared for the procedure, I became slowly more shakey, and I thought to myself, "I'm ready for the sedatives to kick in." The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a numb mouth with gauze, and everything was over; it wasn't really much different from how I would wake up at my computer after suddenly faling asleep from sleep-deprivation. I felt a little dizzy and tired, but it wasn't all that bad. I also didn't embarass myself by acting weird like I've seen on TV many times before. I ended up sleeping for the majority of the ride home, and once I got home, I tried eating some and taking pain pills. Seemingly out of nowhere, I threw up about an hour later, which didn't inspire confidence in the medicine. Today, however, everything seems fine: Naturally, my mouth still hurts, but it's to a degree that I wouldn't have much of a problem going without pain pills (which may cause drowsiness and dizziness. The pain wasn't especially worse yesterday; I just assumed that there was still some numbing in effect). The swelling is hardly noticeable, and there's no discernable bruising. There's minimal bleeding, and the slight dizziness has long worn off. As long as I make sure to take my antibiotics and go easy on my mouth for a while, I don't anticipate any problems. I've heard plenty of stories of things going much worse with wisdom teeth, but I must have gotten a really good surgeon or had it done early enough or something because this isn't very bad at all.

						Today was the first day I didn't talk to Harper at all since early February. A few days ago (since she claimed to not have an opinion on the issue), I told Harper that, although I'd still try to talk to her frequently, I wouldn't try so hard to jam it in if it didn't seem to be working out. This was particularly in response to how my dad might have me working all day and pretty much exclude the possibility of conversation, especially since Harper's early job would cause her to go to bed rather early. Ironically, the thing that kept me from talking to her today was my intense concentration on finishing a code generator for my super cool code that can form nearly unlimited unique symbols. (I did get it finished more or less.) Although I doubt that Harper has been effected much at all by this incident, it still makes me a little sad: Harper means a lot to me, and I had such a good streak going. I talked to Tess today, however, and despite spending days being extremely close to decoding the message I gave her (and Linda) written in my yet-to-be-named symbol code that I just mentioned, she's only just now starting to get through what the message says. I've been prompting her to hurry up for the past few days, but I've had limited success, and it's driving me crazy especially since she won't make a code for me until she finished figuring out mine.
