Especially you told me many English things, and I will never for get them and I will use those things when I meet you next time. And the person at SEMO I could ask whatever question I have to is only you. Besides, I hope you will many friends and hang out with many people and Stephanie. I hope you will come to Japan while we are university students because I can't hang out with people after I start working. And I'm glad to see you enjoyed yourself so much yesterday. I'll see you in Japan or at your house. <span class="elaborate discreet">Who knows?</span><aside>"Who knows?" is a reference to how I would say that to him (and everyone else) all the time.</aside>

							<span class="p1">My dad</span> has been yelling at me about what whales are like, and since he's almost incapable of ever interpreting what I say correctly, he's convinced that I'm just mindlessly refuting whatever he says because I don't like him and think he's an imbecile.

							Wait, he's yelling to you about whales?????? You're not "mindlessly refuting", you're trying to say your input and also facts
						</td>

					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							To give an example, he said how  whale on TV knocked some people into the water probably because they got in the way of it eating. I told him how whales don't eat on the surface and don't care about people. The next thing I know, he's getting mad at me because I supposedly said that whales have no feelings but then tried to backtrack and start telling the truth. Soon enough, he was quoting himself as saying "whales care about people" and me saying "no they don't", but even though that's incorrectly quoted, it's not too unreasonable; however, p1 interpreted it as "whales care about people (most of the time)" and "no they don't (ever)". I asked him why I'm expected to assume his statement wasn't absolute, but he's not supposed to assume that my statement wasn't absolute, but he wasn't about to get caught up in such meaningless details.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							He's getting worked up by arguing about something on the tv? Him judging you based on what you say, but not expecting the same thing in return is hypocritical. Also, why is he so passionate about whales?
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							He's passionate about everything, and he always thinks that people are trying to cut him down, so he needs to angrily defend himself.

						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							Ah. Although being passionate about things is not a bad thing, He's very defensive. Those two together do not mix well.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							Before the whale stuff, a movie about a time machine was on which has a section where people in the future mindlessly shuffle into a building when air raid sirens go off (to get eaten). I had seen the movie before, and despite what p1 keeps telling himself, that part of the movie is not characterized by people going into a church after hearing church bells. It's because of this erroneous association that p1 says he became rather dissatisfied with how the church tries to indoctrinate people to believe certain things.
						</td>

							How does he come up with these things?

					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>

							You always have to be on your toes to catch when things could go down a bad path. What I'm more interested in, though, is how p1 doesn't like the church indoctrinating people but doesn't mind doing it himself.

							That is a good question too!

							Yesterday, p1 was asking me about stuff I've done with Linda (and I told him nothing), and he then decided it was a good time [to say] that "waiting until marriage" was a religious value.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							He gives a lot of mixed signals. But my question is why is it important to say it is a religious value? That side comment isn't necessary.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							I think it's a two-sided statement: 1. If I want to wait until marriage, it's because I'm aspiring to follow religious ideals; and 2. If I'm not religious, then there's no point in waiting until marriage. By the way, religion = goodness, so it's not possible to be good without being religious.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							That's extremely biased and most definitely not true. Plenty of people wait until marriage and are not religious. So number 1 and 2 are out. Besides, people can be and are good and are not be religious. (side note: people can be and are religious and be bad).
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							All good people are religious, but not all religious people are good. If anyone tries to be good but isn't religious, they're dumb hypocrites who are denying the source of all good.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							That doesn't make any sense. I don't think anyone should be judged by what they do or do not believe. You can't judge a person for living his or her life the way he or she wants. Saying that the only people that are good are those who are religious, but not all religious people are good shows that this topic cannot be just black and white. There are good and bad people in this world regardless.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Me:</th>
						<td>
							<span class="p1">My dad</span> has said over and over again how there is only good and bad (no in between), and everyone is born knowing the difference. Since God = good, it's only possible to be good if you follow God's wishes, and bad people are bad because they go against their inner godliness.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Tess:</th>
						<td>
							But religious people can be bad and still follow God, then would [he] consider them still good? His thought process in this is odd. Nothing can be black and white. People are bad because they do bad things for bad reasons; it has nothing to do with their "inner godliness". (I've never heard someone put it that way). Side note: You are good. Nothing is going to change that. (Just don't commit murder okay? That might push you into a gray area...)

							I could continue this conversation, but right now I'm thinking about how p1 is loudly complaining about me to p2 a few feet away. He's saying how I'm an argumentative, ignorant, irresponsible, dummy who never does any work around here. Apparently, I'm 10&times; worse than he was as a kid, and I refuse to attempt to listen to him on anything. He even circled back around to how irrationally defiant I was during the whale argument.

				<section>
					Well thank you for letting me know why you don't really open up much, I would be lying if I didn't say I suspected it might have involved Caitlyn though. I think I can pretty much guarantee that this relationship won't end up the same way mostly because we aren't dating but also because I've never ended a friendship before even at times went it felt like it was going in that direction. I'm not one to give up on a friendship even after it seems like the other person is disinterested in continuing the relationship. I usually try to do anything I can to keep all of my friends, and even when Noah and I broke up for half the year we stayed friends so if you're worried that we'll become closer friends and then I'll cut myself off from you, I can guarantee that at least up until the end of high school that won't happen. (It's not that I would want to end our friendship after that point I just can't promise that after we begin college we'll keep our same relationship.) So I'll always be here for you to open up and even if you aren't comfortable enough around me to open up face to face you can always just actually show your feelings through notes.
				</section>
				<section>
					I know you also expressed being concerned about liking me 'too much' if we became closer friends but I'm personally not really concerned about it. I think that as we become closer you'll realize that I'm not really similar to you in any way and that will cause you to like me less without any physical attraction and later on realizing that we aren't as similar I'm not concerned about you liking me more than you do now. So between your two concerns I feel like you have nothing to worry about
				</section>
				<section>
					<!-- cursive -->
					Also I'll include the half written note to your other message I stopped before I said all that I wanted to but here it is
				</section>
				<section>
					(read second)
				</section>
				<section>
					<!-- cursive -->
					So I'm not actually sure if I'll give you this letter because I'm not sure Noah would really appreciate it, but if I do decide to give it to you I hope you're good at reading cursive handwriting.
				</section>
				<section>
					Anyways, I would just like to start off by thanking you for the indepth candy cane gram. It meant a lot to me especially since I know it was probably hard for you to make the desicion of putting all of your positive feelings out there. I also was starting to get the impression that you really didn't like me or want to be my friend so I started to stop making a lot of conversation with you and stopped asking so many questions. I'm really glad you don't actually hate me though because I enjoy our conversations and even arguing occassionally.

					I want you to know that all of my insults are just jokes and I've actually been trying to pull back and say more meaningful things so that you don't think that I'm serious about some of the things I say. I really do think you're a great person you're very intelligent and helpful and I very much appreciate you trying to explain the concepts I don't understand. I also am like always interested in the 'cool nerdy' things, as you call them, that you share with me. I mean my whole family knows who you are because I'm always telling them what new piece of information you've shared with me.

					Well when we first met you were kinda not sure of what to think of me or my friends. Or so it seemed since it took a while to get you over by us. Now you're just a sassmaster. But everyone needs a little sass in their life. We just get a little extra from you. By the way Happy Birthday! How many seconds have you been 18 for? Bet you don't know! Ha. Well Robert I can truly say you are a one of a kind friend. You are the only one I know you can juggle, calculate seconds till his birthday, make his face the same color as his hair, and create a thingy to know when you have mail. There are many more things that set you apart from the rest but it might take too long to write them all. Now that you're 18 Im sure your sassy self will continue to stay sassy. But you're a good kind of sassy. At least you're not weird like Caymen and Emma. I know I'm your favorite but that can be our little secret. But I know you have a favorite color and just won't tell me. I shall make it my mission to figure it out! Also Im gonna have to find someone to help me with Chemistry next year. Who is gonna? Who will I be able to rant to about my classes? Or tell how I didn't study for a test that is later that day? Whos gonna ask me if anything interesting happened? I guess no one so looks like we are gonna have to kidnap you or is it spelled kidknap. We will Robertabduct you! That's not illegal. Perfect idea! But for real. I can say I doubt I am the only one who is going to miss having you around. You are a pretty rad friend to have whether you know it or not. Everyone needs a Robert Benson in their life. We shall clone you. But I am really not looking forward to the day you and many others will graduate. That's the amazing part of highschool though. You get to make so many friends that make the slightest or the greatest difference in your life. We get to meet people that we will never forget. I can assure you, you are one person I will remember. You are special in every way possible and add a different touch to everyone's life. Getting to know and spend time with you (at school) has been pretty cool. I hope to see much more of you after you leave. Also expect to see you on the news as a growing sensation over some invention or something of yours. No pressure. Well Robert, I want to thank you for all the laughs and chats that make each day at school a bit more interesting. I hope you had a super 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. You are an adult. By golly. Don't get out of control. Hopefully it was as great (or better) than the Happy Birthday that was played for you in band. That was probably the best it was played actually though. Well keep being you Robert Benson. Im sure I can handle the sass. Happy Birthday again. Now there's only 10,454,400 seconds until my birthday. Thats right. I can use a calculator too!

					Dear Robert,<br>
					Hello Robert. It's me, Emma. Although I think you already know me. :) I am writing this letter to you because you wrote one to me. I would like to clear some things up a bit. First off, yes I am a bit scatter brained if you haven't noticed that already. But when you talked about how I don't show you attention like other people do, it slightly startled me. But when I am in band, I tend to hop around to different groups, so it is nothing personal to you.
				</section>
				<section>
					I am so glad that you came out of your shell finally! I honestly don't remember my first impression of you. I just remember talking to you.
				</section>
				<section>
					I feel bad that you didn't get to have everyone play your birthday song. You worked so hard on it. But maybe you can get it printed off Monday. I might still just play extremely high notes.
				</section>
				<section>
					Anyways, Robert, I'm going to miss you next year, and all the years after that. You are a person who will be remembered by everyone. I will always remember you and you will be a story that I will tell to my future kids, their kids, and their kids. You will be a legend! The legend of Robert Henry Benson Jr.! (I don't know your middle name so I just came up with one)

					I'm sorry your friends are terrible at hiding suprise parties, but hopefully you didn't know the scale of the party. So enjoy your special birthday suprise from all of us. Now that it's zero seconds until your birthday open up and share a laugh with all of your friends. You are an adult now so people have to respect you, especially Claire. So mouth off use plenty of sarcasm as these are the best years of your life!

					It's sad to see you go, but I understand the necessity of it, and I wish you the best of luck. I'll always remember your cheerfully quirky demeanor and your endlessly fascinating dreams. I'll also remember the difficulties we've shared with each other and how I was able to give you support when you needed it most. You've been a great friend, and it's been my pleasure getting to know you. With any luck, our paths will cross again in the future, and then you can tell me all about what drink “phase” you're currently in. A lot of people care about you, and I’m proud to consider myself one of them.

					You just had to get the other note before it was time, didn’t you? You need to quit being so impatient. Nevertheless, it gives me an opportunity to say things that I didn’t get the chance to say before. Starting off, I should admit to you that this is actually the third note I wrote to you: Once I learned that you had ruined my surprise, I felt the pressure to put you back in suspense, so I threw together a rather unremarkable note basically stating that I already said everything I wanted to. I haven’t been satisfied with that, though, so I’ve put some real thought into this one. I think the best direction to go with this is to address my more personal thoughts of you since offering you further support could seem repetitive, and it might be a mood-killer anyway. Besides, I have to make this note worth the wait. When I first met you, I was instantly struck by your boundless energy and your unconventional way of thinking; you contributed something to conversations that just can’t be found anywhere else. As time went by, you routinely demonstrated your kindness by enthusiastically greeting me, inviting me to sit with you, and actually involving me in group conversations (although that second one may have been facilitated by the number of times I would “happen” to walk by you). People often assume that I prefer being alone, but in fact, I much prefer being around others, and you are no exception. Despite that, however, it wouldn’t be uncommon for me to pass up an opportunity to be with you because I was worried about what other people (and you) might think if we were around each other too often. As it would just so happen, when I figured out that you needed some help and consequentially started spending more time with you, people began asking me if you were my girlfriend. Originally, I had dismissed the idea on the basis of our significant personality differences, but as we became closer, I began to wonder if our personalities were more complementary than they were incompatible. For a number of reasons, I’m reluctant to come to any definitive conclusions, but I do know that anyone would be lucky to have you. Something else I know is that I really do care about you, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed our time together. Even when the subject matter was serious, it made me happy to know that you felt you could trust me and that I was able to make things just a little bit easier on you. Although it might be bad for me to say so, my favorite time with you was when you refused to leave your bed, and Delilah had to leave to give us privacy: Naturally, I didn’t enjoy how much you were hurting, but as I lay there with you looking into your eyes with my hand placed on your arm, I felt a kind of connection with you that is hard to come by. That feeling wasn’t lost on our hug either. Getting to know you has been one of the best parts of my life, and I hope you’re able to continue being a part of my life for a long time to come.

					I read it. Like I thought it doesn't change my thoughts about you at all. I can't believe you hyped it up so much! I was expecting some serious dirt! Also can you really juggle? If so we need to talk about that more bc I've been wanting to juggle for years. ALSO I had to email the link to myself so I could read it on my computer bc my phone wasn't working and that was a lot of work so be proud of me

					Women in science initiatives
				</h3>
				<section>
					I'm a strong proponent of things being equal for everyone, but unless it's especially necessary, that opinion also extends to giving people special treatment to make up for previously unfair treatment. I know that women have historically been underrepresented in things such as science, and I definitely think everyone should be given an equal opportunity. However, when I hear time and time again about events empowering women in science or groups formed just for girls to learn and collaborate or colleges offering scholarships to women in science, and then I look around in a given biology class of 20 people and see 2 guys, I can't help but think that the dire need to rectify the past mistreatment of women in science has dissipated. Not being a girl, I can't provide any insight on the pressures girls face or what people may say to them in private, but although I've heard the occasional story of old views being perpetuated, I've never witnessed a girl ever being discouraged from pursuing a scientific career, and if I had, I could say with almost complete certainty that everyone in the room would consider such discouragement strongly distasteful. Maybe there's still a generation or two left of people who shy away from girls pursuing scientific careers, but it seems to me that the people in an age range most relevant to me (including older employers) have more or less left those thoughts behind. There will always be those few people who are just plain unreasonable, but they constitute a rather small minority. As a result of these thoughts and observations and the fact that, although I can't definitively say whether girls are brought down somewhat, I definitely don't feel built up, I hear about all of these initiatives for women in science and I wonder where my special treatment is. Why don't people go out of their way to say that I (a guy) can make it in science? Why don't I get to hang out with a bunch of guys and bounce ideas off of each other? Why am I forced to pay more money for my education just because of my gender? I'm inclined to believe that, at least for this generation, women in science initiatives have been so successful that, not only are they no longer necessary, but also, there should be something to help guys get some of the special treatment that has been given to girls for a while now. Not special beyond girls, just equal.
