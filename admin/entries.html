					In case you're interested, there's a number of other things that happened yesterday:

					<li><span>
						I woke up late because I went to bed late because I was working on my <span class="check">calculator</span>.<note-><div><div>It's cool and versatile now, <span class="e33 check">but I should have been doing other things (like sleeping).</span></div></div></note->
					</span></li>
					<li><span>
						I didn't get to eat lunch with <span class="p2"></span> as I had been hoping to start doing on Fridays because I woke up so late.
					</span></li>
					<li><span>
						<span class="p1"></span> ended up jumpstarting someone's car when the person asked us for help when they saw us standing around next to the parking lot. (I left before the action happened, though.)
					</span></li>
					<li><span>
						I did an easy 20 pull-ups at the recreation center (enough to build up my strength, but not so much that I'm sore later).
					</span></li>
					<li><span>
						I saw <span class="check">(what I assumed to be)</span> <span class="p2"></span>'s name on my advisor's appointment sign-up sheet.
					</span></li>
					<li><span>
						I played Super Smash Brothers.
					</span></li>
					<li><span class="e35 check">
						I did my laundry while playing Super Smash Brothers even though it should have been done earlier in the day.
					</span></li>
					<li><span class="e35 check">
						I went to bed late (like I will today) because I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to thoroughly represent my emotions in my entries because I knew I'd be typing this. (And since typing this, I'm doubting everything.)

					Wednesday was <span class="p1"></span>'s birthday. As should be expected with anyone I grow so close to, I couldn't just let this special day pass by without doing something cool for her. Knowing that her favorite animal (and future animal of study) is a bat, I set out to make <span class="p1"></span> an origami bat (which I could hopefully get to flap). After searching the Internet the day before, I came across a number of places which claimed to have instructions for making a flapping origami bat. I picked one and started folding it, but when I got to the end, although it flapped, it didn't really look much like a bat. Dissatisfied, I found different instructions which seemed to give me more of what I wanted and resolved to make it the next day. (It was too late for me to finish it that night.) When Wednesday arrived, I tried to go especially fast through my morning routine <note-><div><div>I've done this twice before, both times so I could try to finish my giant drawing for the following art class.</div></div></note-> so I could have 30 minutes before class to work on making the bat. Although I did get the 30 minutes, making the bat was a long process, so I ended up woking on it a little during class as well as a fair amount between classes. Once I was finished, though, I had a very realistic bat which flapped. I was ready to surprise <span class="p1"></span>.

					When I walked in to Biology, I spotted <span class="p1"></span> and noticed she was sitting in a different place. I was a little confused, but there was still an open seat next to her, so I promptly filled it. The proceeding conversation went something like this:

					As you might imagine, I was rather taken aback by this sudden display of hostility. Although I seemed to have smoothed things over, I didn't expect such a scenario to arise in what's otherwise a mutually enjoyable relationship. Right away, I suspected that there was more to <span class="p1"></span>'s hostility than just tiredness. Furthermore, I suspected that I didn't have to look very far for the reason: As you know, I developed a friendly rivalry with <span class="p1"></span>, similar to the one I had with <span class="p3"></span>. Consequentially, it would be fairly common for me to dish out light-hearted insults. Aware of the potential to hurt her feelings by going to far, I was ever vigilant in my efforts to keep myself in check; however, it wouldn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that I messed up somewhere along the line or that, like <span class="p3"></span>, she didn't let on that the insults were slowly taking their toll. It could be that her tiredness weakened her ability to keep things to herself and inspired her to seek refuge from what would ordinarily be

					I've decided that I'm not going to mess around with trying to indicate my emotions in these planned entries because I might change how I classify things later, anyway, and it's clear that the lack of definitive completion in my emotion indication is preventing me from making progress. I always planned on proof-reading these entries before I added them to the main journal, so it's not like I'm really giving myself much more work to do later. I have no intention of getting rid of any way of people knowing the feelings with which I say something, but I need to have a fully-developed system before I try to start implementing it. Hopefully, things will be easier once I have a clear idea of how to do things; however, if that's not the case, I guess I'll have to devise a simpler way of indicating my emotions because this isn't working (but it's too valuable to eliminate completely). With any luck, I might start making some progress now.
