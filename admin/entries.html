					Saturday, October 28, 2017

				<p class="check"><span>
					I finally told <span class="p1"></span> that I don't think we're compatible. <span class="e43">I had been dreading telling her how I didn't think a relationship between us would work,</span> but yesterday, I finally managed it.<note-><div><span class="e34">I would have managed it on Wednesday, but she ran off for some reason before I could really talk to her.</span></div></note-> <span class="e34">After waiting around <em>forever</em> for her to finish talking to the professor after class <span class="e55">(there's a switch)</span>, I had to catch up with <span class="p1"></span> since she had started walking to her car without me,</span> and it wasn't long until she asked whether I was just walking with her for no reason. <span class="e43">It was then that I knew I had to work up my nerve and follow through on my whole purpose for walking with her that day.</span><span class="e45"> In a manner consistent with someone put in a very awkward situation, I flubbed through what I was trying to say <span class="e34">(even though I had thoroughly rehearsed things in my head beforehand)</span>, but I eventually got my point out,</span><span class="e63"> and it was met with hearty reciprocation.</span> It had crossed my mind that <span class="p1"></span> might share my sentiments of not wanting things to go beyond friendship, but I had generally considered it to be the less likely scenario.<note-><div>There were reasons behind that thought: I wasn't just being pessimistic and/or full of myself.</div></note-> <span class="e63">I was relieved to discover that I was wrong.</span> Technically, I got the impression that she was more afraid of getting into a relationship than she was in agreement with my assertation that we're incompatible, but that could just be a misinterpretation on my part, and regardless, I made my opinion known, <span class="e64">so now I don't have to worry about leading her on whenever I want to spend time with her.</span> I tried to figure out whether I was a little disappointed that I didn't have an admirer, but I don't think I care (at least in this case): we really would have very little chance as a couple, and with that off the table, <span class="e64">I can allow myself to get closer to her without fear of things being taken the wrong way. <span class="t7"><span class="p1"></span>'s a great friend, and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better.</span></span>

					In case you're interested, there's a number of other things that happened yesterday:
				</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>I woke up late because I went to bed late because I was working on my <span class="check">calculator</span>.<note-><div>It's cool and versatile now, <span class="e33 check">but I should have been doing other things (like sleeping).</span></div></note-></li>
					<li>I didn't get to eat lunch with <span class="p2"></span> as I had been hoping to start doing on Fridays because I woke up so late.</li>
					<li><span class="p1"></span> ended up jumpstarting someone's car when the person asked us for help when they saw us standing around next to the parking lot. (I left before the action happened, though.)</li>
					<li>I did an easy 20 pull-ups at the recreation center (enough to build up my strength, but not so much that I'm sore later).</li>
					<li>I saw <span class="check">(what I assumed to be)</span> <span class="p2"></span>'s name on my advisor's appointment sign-up sheet.</li>
					<li>I played Super Smash Brothers.</li>
					<li class="e35 check">I did my laundry while playing Super Smash Brothers even though it should have been done earlier in the day.</li>
					<li class="e35 check">I went to bed late (like I will today) because I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to thoroughly represent my emotions in my entries because I knew I'd be typing this. (And since typing this, I'm doubting everything.)</li>
