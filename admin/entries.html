					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="p1"></span> ended up jumpstarting someone's car when the person asked us for help when they saw us standing around next to the parking lot. (I left before the action happened, though.)
					</li>
					<li>
						I did an easy 20 pull-ups at the recreation center (enough to build up my strength, but not so much that I'm sore later).
					</li>
					<li>
						I saw <span class="check">(what I assumed to be)</span> <span class="p2"></span>'s name on my advisor's appointment sign-up sheet.
					</li>
					<li>
						I played Super Smash Brothers.

						I did my laundry while playing Super Smash Brothers even though it should have been done earlier in the day.
					</span></li>
					<li><span class="e35 check">
						I went to bed late (like I will today) because I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to thoroughly represent my emotions in my entries because I knew I'd be typing this. (And since typing this, I'm doubting everything.)

				<section>
					Wednesday was <span class="p1"></span>'s birthday. As should be expected with anyone I grow so close to, I couldn't just let this special day pass by without doing something cool for her. Knowing that her favorite animal (and future animal of study) is a bat, I set out to make <span class="p1"></span> an origami bat (which I could hopefully get to flap). After searching the Internet the day before, I came across a number of places which claimed to have instructions for making a flapping origami bat. I picked one and started folding it, but when I got to the end, although it flapped, it didn't really look much like a bat. Dissatisfied, I found different instructions which seemed to give me more of what I wanted and resolved to make it the next day. (It was too late for me to finish it that night.) When Wednesday arrived, I tried to go especially fast through my morning routine <note-><div><div>I've done this twice before, both times so I could try to finish my giant drawing for the following art class.</div></div></note-> so I could have 30 minutes before class to work on making the bat. Although I did get the 30 minutes, making the bat was a long process, so I ended up woking on it a little during class as well as a fair amount between classes. Once I was finished, though, I had a very realistic bat which flapped. I was ready to surprise <span class="p1"></span>.

					When I walked in to Biology, I spotted <span class="p1"></span> and noticed she was sitting in a different place. I was a little confused, but there was still an open seat next to her, so I promptly filled it. The proceeding conversation went something like this:

					As you might imagine, I was rather taken aback by this sudden display of hostility. Although I seemed to have smoothed things over, I didn't expect such a scenario to arise in what's otherwise a mutually enjoyable relationship. Right away, I suspected that there was more to <span class="p1"></span>'s hostility than just tiredness. Furthermore, I suspected that I didn't have to look very far for the reason: As you know, I developed a friendly rivalry with <span class="p1"></span>, similar to the one I had with <span class="p3"></span>. Consequentially, it would be fairly common for me to dish out light-hearted insults. Aware of the potential to hurt her feelings by going to far, I was ever vigilant in my efforts to keep myself in check; however, it wouldn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to believe that I messed up somewhere along the line or that, like <span class="p3"></span>, she didn't let on that the insults were slowly taking their toll. It could be that her tiredness weakened her ability to keep things to herself and inspired her to seek refuge from what would ordinarily be _________________________________.

				<section>
					I've decided that I'm not going to mess around with trying to indicate my emotions in these planned entries because I might change how I classify things later, anyway, and it's clear that the lack of definitive completion in my emotion indication is preventing me from making progress. I always planned on proof-reading these entries before I added them to the main journal, so it's not like I'm really giving myself much more work to do later. I have no intention of getting rid of any way of people knowing the feelings with which I say something, but I need to have a fully-developed system before I try to start implementing it. Hopefully, things will be easier once I have a clear idea of how to do things; however, if that's not the case, I guess I'll have to devise a simpler way of indicating my emotions because this isn't working (but it's too valuable to eliminate completely). With any luck, I might start making some progress now.

					The first thing I'm sure you'll notice is that this date is prior to the one you just read (if you're someone who reads the dates). Ordinarily, I'd prefer to do things sequentially, but by the time I get around to typing all of that other stuff up, all of the interesting things that happened to me today would be old news. Since it's an especially inconvenient time for me to be recounting my day, I'm going to try to be brief. I'm just going to number things, so I don't have to spend time transitioning; everything will be numbered in order of increasing importance.
				</section>
				<ol>
					<li value="7">
						I did my laundry today. Things were a little more crowded than expected probably because the washing machine room was flooded over the weekend, and no one could do their laundry. In case I don't say it in something preceeding this, I chose Wednesdays to do my laundry because my classes end at 2:20, and my only class on Thursday starts at 1:30 (the same one that ends at 2:20).
					</li>
					<li value="6">
						I saw <span class="p2"></span> at dinner today, and I didn't even try to walk by and say "hi". Granted, I did get there late, she was finished eating, and she was especially far off in the corner, but I consider it a win nonetheless. That's not to say that I'm over the nonsense which I'm sure you're familiar with by now, but I think the decreased contact (as if there was ever much contact in the first place) is helping take some of the edge off. Occasionally, I run into her when she's a little extra dressed-up or maybe she doesn't completely ignore me, and I feel myself wanting to get a little too excited, but I think things are generally headed in the right direction.
					</li>
					<li value="5">
						I had a Biology test today. As is typically the case, I somehow didn't manage to find the time to really study beforehand with the exception of a small amount of time immediately preceeding the test. As is also typical, I had difficulties finishing the test on time, but I don't think I did too badly. Maybe if I studied, the answers would come to me more quickly. (For the record, though, there aren't only frivolous reasons behind my failures to study.)
					</li>
					<li value="4">
						My Chemistry class was canceled today. The reason behind it was that the professor was going to present his research later that day. He invited the class to come, and I actually decided to go. (What did you expect? I'm a nerd.) There were a number of professors there, but I'd say the vast majority was composed of students. It turns out that my professor is researching more cost-effective and versitile ways of creating carbon compounds. (I should have seen that one coming: what chemist isn't doing that?) It was moderately interesting and caused me to have to rush through lunch to get to my next class on time.
					</li>
					<li value="3">
						My electric razor stopped working today for no apparent reason. Yesterday, it had run out of charge, so I plugged it in to charge over night. When I tried to use it today, however, it just wouldn't turn on. Sometimes it would do that the first time I turned it on after charging (still for no apparent reason), but it would always resolve itself. Such was not the case this time. In response, I put off all of the other necessary things I was going to do so I could order a new one. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to try to keep my rapidly-growing facial hair at bay with scissors. (Scissors are an awful thing to try to use as a replacement for an electric razor, particulary when you want a clean shave.)
					</li>  <!-- talk about Boys State -->
					<li value="2">
						<span class="p7"></span> finally convinced me to let him move into my room. It seems that he was having problems with his roommate keeping him up late with loud noises, and with upcoming tests and stuff, <span class="p7"></span> was getting desperate. We had extensive talks about my reservations with him moving in, and I made sure to tell him how he needs to express his feelings to his roommate rather than stay silent, but over time, it seemed to me that <span class="p7"></span> had made at least a mild attempt to bring up his concerns, and it also seemed that he's reasonably capable of not making me feel awkward at every waking moment. Eventually, I agreed, and although he was happy, he didn't get quite as celebratory as he might have otherwise, probably because he knew how seriously I was taking this. Preliminary results seem to suggest that things will be okay, but I think there has to be more than one day of evidence to work with before such a statement could be said conclusively. Regardless, things will be certainly be more interesting from here on out.
					</li>  <!-- I changed something above here. -->
					<li value="1">
						I reached the top of Google. As I was looking through my emails today (which apparently aren't causing notifications to be sent to my phone), I noticed two emails saying something I'd never seen before: a number of people had visited one of my websites. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the wesite was the one where I talked about <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/canphonesandcorners/">getting can phones to go around corners</a>. Apparently, in December, 123 users visited my site, and in January, 250 users did. None of them were even me! The average time spent on my website was about 40 seconds, and they generally only looked once. What I found particularly interesting was that 70% or so came from "referral", meaning that there's apparently a fair number of links out there on other websites which people are following to my website. (Alternatively, there's one link on a moderately popular website.) Even more interesting was that greater than 25% of people came from an "organic search", meaning that they searched Google and found my website. Considering how, last time I checked, my website was so far away from the top of the results that I couldn't find it, this came as quite a surprise to me. Naturally, the first thing I did was search for "how to make can phones go around corners", and what do I see at the very top of the results but my website!!!! I have no idea how this could have happened, but I've obviously done something right in those four years I hardly did anything (the site was published on February 3, 2014). When you make it to the top of Google, you know you've made it in life. Suddenly, I have this compulsion to do some maintainence on my website, so I can give my followers a better experience. Who knows: maybe when I get this month's update<note-><div><div>I didn't get updates before, presumably because my website wasn't important enough.</div></div></note-> I'll have more than 300 users who visited the site! Some of you may think that the overall importance of this part of my day should have ranked below <span class="p7"></span> moving in with me (or, in this case, above), but some of you would be wrong: Some people spend a lifetime trying to get to the top of Google but never achieve it (let's forget for a moment that Google isn't even a lifetime old); I, however, have beaten the odds and reached the pinnacle of Internet noteriety. For the forseeable future, <em>I</em> will be the authority on all things related to can phones and corners; <em>I</em> will be the go-to resource for solutions to "string"ent problems; and <em>I</em> will have influence over <em>hundreds</em> of people. My immortalization has already begun.

					Sunday was my Birthday! As time goes by, I feel like I should talk about something else or just wait until a different noteworthy event occurs, but I don't want to wait another whole year to talk about something so cool (as is typical), and I can throw in a few other interesting things as well.

					The day started off with gigantic snowflakes/clumps coming from the sky. Later on, I modified the <a href="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/cramped/seconds">countdowns on Cramped</a> to make annual countdowns wait for a day at 0 before resetting for the next year.

					Today was a rather unproductive day but fairly interesting. (Typing this doesn't help my productivity.) After waking up at 12:38pm, I went to breakfast and came back with the intent of working on some homework. However, remembering how I had started digitizing the things I need to write in this journal yesterday, I decided to finish it up (not counting things I hadn't written down yet). Hours later, I finally finished, and it was about time to go to dinner. I would have went right away, but I was delayed when one of <span class="p7"></span>'s friends came over and <span class="p7"></span> started giving me a bunch of Japanese food to try. (I also tried asking his friend what the proper way of saying "weirdo" is in Japanese to little success.) At dinner, who would I see but <span class="p2"></span>. I had seen her sitting by herself in a corner a number of times now, and through all of those times, I resisted the urge to sit with her (especially since she would enevitably get up and leave soon after I sat with her since she didn't have much food left and didn't want to play on her phone while I was talking to her<note-><div><div>There have been many times when I would see her finished with her food, not sit with her, and yet when I'm leaving, see her still sitting there playing on her phone (not using it to talk to someone). However, any time I've sat with her (with the possible exception of the first or second time), she has promptly gotten up and left once she had finished eating. I think it's more of a not-wanting-to-waste-time-when-she's-being-held-accountable sort of thing as opposed to a wanting-to-get-away-from-me-as-soon-as-possible thing, but who really knows?</div></div></note->). This time, though, I saw that she had a decent amount of food left, and it had been quite some time since I had sat with her last<note-><div><div>Even if she's not interested in a relationship (which I don't even know if I am), I'd still consider us more or less friends, and I sit with the rest of my friends more than that. (It's been at least a month or two.)</div></div></note->, so I decided to drop by. We talked, and everything seemed to go pretty well: the conversation wasn't nearly as dead as it normally is, and she seemed pretty cheerful and giggly<note-><div><div>Once again, giggly isn't quite the right word: she was just laughing a lot.</div></div></note->. When she finished eating and started to leave, I told her, "What? you don't want to play on your phone while you're having a conversation with me?", and she knew it was the truth. I think I made it through the whole encounter without acquiring another massive crush on her. Since I then found myself alone in a corner, I moved my plate with the rest of my food towards the center of the dining hall so I could be closer to the action (which was basically non-existent). As I was finishing up, one of the girls who regularly works in the dining hall came over to me and started asking me questions about what I thought of the gospel and how my life fits into it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting my dinner to go in that direction, and although she was fairly nice (just like the rest of them), it was still pretty awkward. I don't know what inspired her to come over to me when she never did before for the whole year up to now. On my way back to my room, I decided to take the elevator, and I was joined by three girls acting in a goofy manner; I wouldn't have thought much of it if it weren't for the fairly pungent smell of alcohol eminating from them. When I finally made it back to my room, I started working on this but remembered that there was some homework I really wanted to fininsh so it would seem like I had actually accomplished something today. After getting a few problems of that done, my parents called, and there went about an hour and a half of my time. While talking to them, I tried to bring up the idea of letting me travel abroad for a semester, and probably because of the way I established a certain context and eased into it, they almost seemed to be in agreement (or at least my dad did; who knows what my mom thought considering how she didn't have much an opportunity to offer her opinion on the subject). Once I had escaped the conversation, I finished the assignment I had started and resolved to quickly add this entry so there could be another small glimpse into my daily life (despite the fact that there are other longer and more important things that I want to write about but don't have time for). However, considering how it's 12:57am<note-><div><div>The date is still from "yesterday".</div></div></note-> and I effectively started this almost two hours ago, I don't think I'm doing very well on the "quickly" part. I haven't even gotten ready for bed yet; the constant recurrence of situation can be quite frustrating.

				<section>
					As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.
				</section>
				<section>
					I <strong>hate</strong> my addiction. I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between <span class="p3"></span> and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). <span class="p3"></span> is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

					Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the third of my pants that were a little too tight for me.<note-><div><div>They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance. Luckily, I got some new pants this past summer or else about half of them would be a little too tight.</div></div></note->

					<span class="p7"></span> offered to pay for a trip to Japan for me today. Although he has invited me to stay with him in Japan on numerous occasions, this is the first time that he seemed to be serious about a proposal of my visit (or at least serious enough that he offered to pay when he saw that finances posed a significant hurdle). There are a number of things I could say on this topic, but my main purpose here was to get the date recorded for future reference; I don't really have time for anything else, especially considering how it's crunch-time for finishing the website for <span class="3"></span>. You can be sure that I'll be talking about this later, though.

					I finally finished the website for <span class="p3"></span> (on Thursday). If you're paying attention, you'll notice that Thursday wasn't the day after <span class="p3"></span>'s birthday (that would have been Monday). Despite significant determination, I just couldn't get it done on time. For nearly two weeks, I've been getting miserable sleep in an effort to get things done as soon as possible: the first week averaged out to something like 5 hours of sleep a night, and starting after I woke up on Sunday going through Thursday, I got a total of about 5 hours of sleep. I felt like I was back at Boston University. I thought for sure I'd crash and not be able to keep up the sleep deprivation long enough to finish the website, but somehow, my body adapted and allowed me to stay relatively awake throughout that time. A little after 9:00 Thursday night, I sent <span class="p3"></span> texts consisting of the following:
				</section>
				<section style="padding: 0rem 10rem 0rem 10rem">
					"This is Robert Benson. I would appreciate it if you could go to this URL (preferably on a computer): https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/specialprojects/srt/bunnies. (There's an animation I made there.) I would also appreciate it if you could respond to this text at some point, so I could minimally know that you received it. I would mean a lot to me for you to see it, so I may make further attempts to cause such to be a reality."<br>
					...<br>
					"Also, happy late birthday. (I was supposed to tell you that in the first place.)"
				</section>
				<section>
					I spent a significant amount of time trying to convince myself that it didn't matter whether <span class="p3"></span> saw the animation, and I was initially successful, but after killing myself trying to get it finished, I can't help but think that it <em>does</em> matter. I haven't heard back from her, so I sent her a short text today asking if she received my texts. Tomorrow, I'll ask <span class="p9"></span> if she knows whether her number is still valid. If it's not, I still haven't deleted my Facebook account yet, and I know that <span class="p3"></span> has an account, so that's where I'll go next. I'm reasonably convinced that I'll be able to contact her through some means. I was also reasonably convinced that she'd be willing to respond to me if I requested it, but if it turns out that her phone number still works, it would seem that I was mistaken. I think the animation has an excellent mix of humor and thoughtfulness, and if she would watch it, I think that there would be a good chance that she would be willing to entertain the notion of giving me another chance. She has to see it, though.

					There are a number of things I should be doing, especially since I've been doing almost nothing but programming for nearly two weeks, but I'm just exhausted, and I want someone to help relieve me of some of this stress; this is as close as I can get to that. My parents are going to call tonight, and I'm wondering what I'm going to tell them because, eventually, my dad will stop talking, and they'll want to know what I've been doing and whether I've rectified all of the things they're disappointed in. (No.) I'm going to have to think hard about what I did besides programming for <span class="p3"></span> (which would be a terrible idea to tell them about) and then try to make it seem like that could have filled up my whole week. Luckily, they've convinced themselves that I rarely do anything productive, so it will be much more likely that they assume my lack of things to say about my week is an indication of how much time I've wasted rather than an indication of my reluctance to confide in them with my personal problems. I actually had a dream about my parents last night: It started off being more about me being held prisoner in my house and later shifted a little bit to my dad enforcing even more strict rules upon me and then leaving with my mom for a short time. In that time, I decided that the line had finally been crossed, and I coordinated an "escape" with my friends.<note-><div><div>They weren't really friends that you or I would know outside of the dream; they were just friends.</div></div></note-> I started packing up the most important stuff and loading it into my friend's car, but before I could get the last of my stuff, my parents came back and put an end to it. They treated me as if I was a little kid making an irrational decision to run away from home, and all I could think about was how I was all the more determined to get out of there the moment they left again. Even after waking up, the idea of escaping the condescension of my parents/dad and exploring the world in a car with my friends didn't seem too unappealing; however, I don't particularly expect it to happen. Tying things back into the original topic of this entry, I also had a dream about <span class="p3"></span> last night: Somehow, <span class="p3"></span> and I both ended up at a party thrown by <span class="p9"></span> (which meant to me that her phone number was almost certainly still good). As I stood off to the side, I could hear <span class="p3"></span> talking to a bunch of people about how she had had intimate relations with some guy, and presumably because she had gotten hooked, she had since then been entertaining an addiction much like my own. The tone was rather light-hearted. I wasn't sure how to feel about it then, and I still don't.

					I really messed up my relationship with <span class="p3"></span>. The only person I've ever felt closer to is <span class="p5"></span>, and that's just because I didn't make such an attempt to restrain myself as I did with <span class="p3"></span>. Moreover, I don't think there's <em>anyone</em> who I've gotten along with better. (I'm sure you've heard this all before.) <span class="p3"></span> is an exceptional person, and it pains me deeply that she's no longer in my life. I'm hoping that the website I made will help make things right, but there's no guaruntee of that, and I couldn't think much lesser of her for not being able to move on regardless. I guess only time will tell.

					In my attempt to find out where p6 lives, I stumbled across p12's house (who she's not related to). As it turns out, p12 lives in the same neighborhood as p5, if not the same street. (I don't remember exactly where p5 lives.) Moreover, he lives close enough to fairly easily walk to her house (based on my general knowledge of where it should be), and I surely passed by his house when going to p5's house. There must be more people I know who live nearby, but I still consider it pretty interesting.
