				<ol>
					<li>
						1/25/2019 (Friday): Saw Harper sitting alone at dinner (again) and sat with her.
					</li>
					<li>
						1/29/2019 (Tuesday): Sat with Harper at dinner and found out she hasn't been going to classes and is dropping out. Talked about funeral? Jamie joined later.
					</li>
					<li>
						1/30/2019 (Wednesday): Harper had dinner with me and I brought up how she doesn't seem as happy as usual. Told her about my ADHD and she told me about her depression. (I still had to get a ride to get my medicine.)
					</li>
					<li>
						1/31/2019 (Thursday): Josh and girlfriend "rooting" for me. Harper invited me to watch TV but I had to turn her down.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/1/2019 (Friday): Was asked if "that girl" was my girlfriend.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/2/2019 (Saturday): Texted Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/3/2019 (Sunday): "Are you becoming thoroughly acquainted with the confines of the fifth floor?" Snuck onto the sixth floor of Towers East but couldn't get to room before Harper came (and was surprised). Ate dinner with Harper. Got her to go to Towers South Super Bowl party (lame). Sneakily followed Harper and went on her "night walk".
					</li>
					<li>
						2/4/2019 (Monday): Texted Harper to take all of her medicine. Rolled Harper out of bed and tried to get her to order her medicine. Harper says she's fine and has a plan that ends in "f". Tried to make me promise not to "snitch". Took a day walk. The plan was "kill myself". (Freeze to death, jump off high place, run into traffic, slit wrists.) I calmly tried to persuade her to persevere. (Have to power through to get to the good times, even if the bad times last 10 years; I had to keep going even when Sarah left; don't want to traumatize people; she's a great person to be around.) Told me I talked like a therapist. We ate dinner with Delilah.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/5/2019 (Tuesday): Texted Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/6/2019 (Wednesday): Ordered roses for Harper. Tried really hard to get Harper out of bed. Got up, gave me putty, went to bed. Hit her with stuff, stared at her, and got into bed with her. Tried hurting herself to make me leave. (Never tried it with a charger before.) Delilah left. I layed down with Harper and tried getting her to talk. She didn't want to cry. She doesn't have to think about anything when she's asleep. I held her arm and she even put my hand back on when she repositioned herself. Suicide hotline also said she could still turn her life around. I realized she would have to leave. Awkward moment when she started falling asleep at end. Hugged. Good-night handshake. Couldn't really concentrate on anything afterwards.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/7/2019 (Thursday): Woke up early to do lab work. Texted Harper. Ended up going to breakfast to try to stay awake and ate with Harper. Harper left later in the day.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/8/2019 (Friday): Cancelled rose order. Tried convincing Harper to talk on the phone to me. She fell asleep on me but I did the same to her. Victorious.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/9/2019 (Saturday): Talked to Harper on the phone. She stopped talking when one of her parents came home but I finished story. Made origami and a note for Harper. Had to slip it under her door. Had to tell Harper about it when I discovered Delilah went home for weekend. Harper freaked out.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/10/2019 (Sunday): Harper didn't come to get her stuff since the roads were too icy. Ignored me and got Delilah to tell her what the note said. "I LOVE YOU". Made a new note and origami. Scolded Delilah and delivered. Delilah definitely should taunt Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/11/2019 (Monday): Tried to see if Harper was burning up inside. (No.) She had a dream about coming back and getting both notes. Probably coming Saturday despite the likelihood that I won't be around.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/12/2019 (Tuesday): Texted about Krispy Kreme, donuts, and the doctor's office.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/13/2019 (Wednesday): Texted random stuff and told Harper how I'll probably be around on Saturday.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/14/2019 (Thursday): 
					</li>
					<li>
						2/15/2019 (Friday):
					</li>
					<li>
						2/16/2019 (Saturday): Barely finished replacement note (had to print it). Harper came in red SUV. I kept her company while she ate Burger King. (She was a little crazier than I remembered.) Helped her a little with packing. She was shaking a lot (because of medications?). Was about to let me meet her parents but decided I should "finish the swan" instead. Her parents accompanied her back after the first load. (I had to clear out.) Camped out in stairwell for no reason. Caught back up with her after she finished emptying her room. Gave her note and flapping swan. Later hugged. Watched Harper leave. Harper read note.
