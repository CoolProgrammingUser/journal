					Addiction entry
				</h2>
				<section>
					As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.
				</section>
				<section>
					I <strong>hate</strong> my addiction. I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between Sarah and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). Sarah is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

					Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the third of my pants that were a little too tight for me.<note-><div><div>They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance. Luckily, I got some new pants this past summer or else about half of them would be a little too tight.</div></div></note->

				<ol>
					<li>
						1/25/2019 (Friday): Saw Harper sitting alone at dinner (again) and sat with her.
					</li>
					<li>
						1/29/2019 (Tuesday): Sat with Harper at dinner and found out she hasn't been going to classes and is dropping out. Talked about funeral? Jamie joined later.
					</li>
					<li>
						1/30/2019 (Wednesday): Harper had dinner with me and I brought up how she doesn't seem as happy as usual. Told her about my ADHD and she told me about her depression. (I still had to get a ride to get my medicine.)
					</li>
					<li>
						1/31/2019 (Thursday): Josh and girlfriend "rooting" for me. Harper invited me to watch TV but I had to turn her down.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/1/2019 (Friday): Was asked if "that girl" was my girlfriend.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/2/2019 (Saturday): Texted Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/3/2019 (Sunday): "Are you becoming thoroughly acquainted with the confines of the fifth floor?" Snuck onto the sixth floor of Towers East but couldn't get to room before Harper came (and was surprised). Ate dinner with Harper. Got her to go to Towers South Super Bowl party (lame). Sneakily followed Harper and went on her "night walk".
					</li>
					<li>
						2/4/2019 (Monday): Texted Harper to take all of her medicine. Rolled Harper out of bed and tried to get her to order her medicine. Harper says she's fine and has a plan that ends in "f". Tried to make me promise not to "snitch". Took a day walk. The plan was "kill myself". I calmly tried to persuade her to persevere. We ate dinner with Delilah.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/5/2019 (Tuesday): Texted Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/6/2019 (Wednesday): Ordered roses for Harper. Tried really hard to get Harper out of bed. Got up, gave me putty, went to bed. Hit her with stuff, stared at her, and got into bed with her. Tried hurting herself to make me leave. Delilah left. I layed down with Harper and tried getting her to talk. She didn't want to cry. She doesn't have to think about anything when she's asleep. I held her arm and she even put my hand back on when she repositioned herself. I realized she would have to leave. Awkward moment when she started falling asleep at end. Hugged. Good-night handshake. Couldn't really concentrate on anything afterwards.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/7/2019 (Thursday): Woke up early to do lab work. Texted Harper. Ended up going to breakfast to try to stay awake and ate with Harper. Harper left later in the day.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/8/2019 (Friday): Cancelled rose order. Tried convincing Harper to talk on the phone to me. She fell asleep on me but I did the same to her. Victorious.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/9/2019 (Saturday): Talked to Harper on the phone. She stopped talking when one of her parents came home but I finished story. Made origami and a note for Harper. Had to slip it under her door. Had to tell Harper about it when I discovered Delilah went home for weekend. Harper freaked out.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/10/2019 (Sunday): Harper didn't come to get her stuff since the roads were too icy. Ignored me and got Delilah to tell her what the note said. "I LOVE YOU". Made a new note and origami. Scolded Delilah and delivered. Delilah definitely should taunt Harper.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/11/2019 (Monday): Tried to see if Harper was burning up inside. (No.) She had a dream about coming back and getting both notes. Probably coming Saturday despite the likelihood that I won't be around.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/12/2019 (Tuesday): Texted about Krispy Kreme, donuts, and the doctor's office.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/13/2019 (Wednesday): Texted random stuff and told Harper how I'll probably be around on Saturday.
					</li>
					<li>
						2/14/2019 (Thursday): 
					</li>
					<li>
						2/15/2019 (Friday):
					</li>
					<li>
						2/16/2019 (Saturday): Barely finished replacement note (had to print it). Harper came in red SUV. I kept her company while she ate Burger King. (She was a little crazier than I remembered.) Helped her a little with packing. Was about to let me meet her parents but decided I should "finish the swan" instead. Her parents accompanied her back after the first load. (I had to clear out.) Camped out in stairwell for no reason. Caught back up with her after she finished emptying her room. Gave her note and flapping swan. Later hugged. Watched Harper leave. Harper read note.
