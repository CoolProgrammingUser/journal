			<section>
				<span class="h-o2">Although I demonstrate a mastery of English so remarkable that my intent could hardly be misunderstood in any of my exceptionally vivid recollections of my experiences,</span> I occasionally worry that my sense of humor or subtlety won't be apparent enough to the readers of this journal. In an effort to compensate for this, I've attempted to create ways to better express what I'm trying to say. Ideally, particularly with the emotion, I'd like to be able to represent everything with varying combinations of a small number of aspects, but in the interests of actually making some kind of progress in this journal, I've opted to throw together something and make any optimizations in the future. For the scales I do have established (and the ones which have a description), it's worth noting that, although close, the description isn't necessarily exact; some attention should be paid to the general trends I establish. Since it can be difficult discern exactly what shade a given color is, I made sure that color-dependent indicators display a written indication of the specific tone being expressed when hovered over or when touched and held. It's worth noting that any humor or subtlety I may be exhibiting at a given time <strong>will not</strong> be demonstrated in my indicators: The indicators don't do you much good if I may be joking with those too. Keep in mind, however, that I'm not always going to indicate a change in honesty or emotional state: I tried that at one point, and it only took me that one time to discover that I'd never be able to keep it up. Consequentially, I'm only likey to indicate things when I want to emphasize something or when I think there's a potential to be misunderstood.

					Honesty
				</h2>
				<section>
					Although I wouldn't say that I'm ever lying, there are times when I'm not really being serious, and you wouldn't be the first person to sometimes get confused about exactly when those times are. As such, I provided a way to indicate how seriously I expect you to take me. Of the honesty options I may choose, the one which most likely requires an explanation is "<span class="h2">suggestive</span>": I primarily use this when I'm implying that something might actually be true in an otherwise false statement or when I'm leaving out some important considerations which can influence what the reasonable conclusion is. My baseline honesty is <span class="h3">h3</span>.

				<h2>
					Emotion
				</h2>
				<section>
					As you might guess, this shows you how I indicate my emotions in my writing. "Contentment" and "Energy" are my attempts to find the underlying components to emotion (and the extra emotions are what I do when those components fail me). For these purposes, "contentment" means how much I like something, and "energy" means how vigorous I feel while experiencing the emotion. You'll notice how not all of the emotions have a description. That's primarily a result of me not being certain what would be categorized as such an emotion; you shouldn't worry too much about those, though, because if I don't even know what would make me feel like that, I'm not likely to use that indicator. My baseline emotional state (and the generally assumed emotion with which I write) is objectively content or something like <span class="e54">e54</span> or <span class="e55">e55</span>.

					Classes
				</h2>
				<section>
					In the programming language of HTML (and CSS), classes are ways of giving sections/elements of a website certain styling. There isn't much need to spend too much time trying to figure these out because they're fairly self-explanatory and/or unimportant. However, you may want to take notice of the fact that you can click on people's names as well as just about anything with <span class="elaborate">dotted underlines</span> or {braces}.
