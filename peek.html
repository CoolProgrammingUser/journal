				This is the section of my journal devoted to throwing together certain things I want certain people to see at a certain time. You'll notice how there's no navigation section which is my way of demonstrating my preference that you not try to find the rest of my journal. I don't think it would be too difficult to find everything else, and I surely trust you a sizeable amount to refer you here at all, so it wouldn't be the end of the world if you gained access to it all, but I'd like you to wait. Since the information here is only meant for specific situations, you shouldn't expect it to remain here indefinitely. Aside from that, I hope this accomplishes what it's meant to.

						As a disclaimer, I'm totally faking the emotion in what I'm about to type. <span class="elaborate obvious">Admission</span><aside>Technically, I can psych myself up for it and get pretty close, but it's not natural.</aside> It's not that I didn't feel the emotion at one point; it's just that I don't feel it right now, and although my general policy in this case is to wait for the feeling to come back during a time when I'm more available to put things in this journal (as I've been doing), recent events have led me to believe that this lull could be permanent or at least very long-lasting. Since I don't think that this should be overlooked, I'm including it despite having shifted to a different mindset. Naturally, I could describe it in the past tense (which wouldn't require a disclaimer), but it just wouldn't be the same. For the record, it's quite rare that I finish even an intensely emotional entry in one day, and since the intensity of the emotion dissipates within a day or two, I'm faking the emotion for the rest of those entries as well; I bet you can't tell the difference. As another disclaimer, I'm not going to put the least bit of effort into finishing this entry today; I just want this date to precede the stuff that I really want to talk about (and I won't fake the date). Furthermore, I'm likely going to move this out of sequential order and into wherever I think it makes the most sense (which is surely where you're reading this now). If I'm faking the emotion, I might as well fake the order. For the time being, though, it's probably best if you pretended that I'm not faking the extent of my feelings because I really did feel this way, and I wouldn't want you to get confused in the context of the surrounding entries (although that probably already happened).

						I <strong><em>really</em></strong> want a girlfriend. Just to be clear, this isn't inspired by the common motivation of finding someone to entertain a certain particularly intimate activity; I just really want the kind of close companionship that's most easily obtained from a girlfriend. It's been about 5 years since I was with Caitlyn, and although I wasn't too eager to jump right into another relationship at the time, I'm more than ready now. With starts and stops over time, I've been feeling this way since the second semester of last year. Though subtle and mainly observed within my mind, I've noticed changes in my thoughts and behavior: I've become significantly more likely to evaluate the appearances of girls and possibly treat them a little differently than I would normally; very often when talking to a girl, I'm silently gauging their compatibility with me; I could swear that I've been exhibiting a greater propensity for sitting with and conversing with girls instead of guys (but then again, I've been wondering about that for a long time); I've become rather unconcerned if my actions are perceived as flirting; I'm often plotting ways to spend more time with girls... Although there's a decent chance that I'm not giving my restraint enough credit, there are many times when I feel like I'm just barely preventing myself from professing my undying love to whoever I may be with at the time, especially if they're pretty and more so if I know them kind-of well. Depending on who I'm with, I may be having a casual friendly conversation with a girl, but in my head I'm thinking, "Wow, she's pretty." "I never want to stop talking with her." "How can I get her to meet up with me some other time?" "Come on, give me your phone number!" I feel like I've developed a kind of moderate insanity. I know there are plenty of guys out there (and surely girls as well) who would read this and be amused by my response to the kind of life they've embraced long ago, but I've come to expect some degree of rationality from my life, and it's disconcerting to have that thrown into question. At the same time, though, I'm typically not thinking about how disconcerting it is because I'm so overwhelmed by my exceptionally intense desire to have a girlfriend. It could be that my perception of the strength of the feeling is altered by my lack of experience with it, but regardless, the feeling is strong enough to occasionally inspire me to give serious consideration to the likelihood that I'll suddenly ask someone out without sufficient reason. What makes it worse is that there are quite a few girls who would almost certainly go out with me if I asked, and there are quite a few more who would likely be receptive to the idea if I turned up the charm for a little while. I can't do it, though: It's my responsibility to myself to make sure that a romantic relationship has an above average chance of success before I enter into it so any potential pain can be reduced. However, my conviction in that belief is faltering: Is the risk of potential pain really that high? Would I really have such a hard time bouncing back from a bad relationship? Is it really that bad to get into a relationship without knowing an excessive amount about that person? It has become an increasingly prevalent thought that I should decrease the requirements for people to become my girlfriend, and even if it doesn't work out, at least being in a short-lived relationship could take the edge off. This is aided by my reasoning that, as paranoid as I may be after what happened with Caitlyn and Sarah, it's still generally unlikely that such experiences will repeat themselves. As such, it's difficult for me to counter how badly I want a girlfriend. And I mean really, <em>really</em> want a girlfriend (as if you didn't understand that before). I just want a girlfriend so badly. I want someone's hand to hold; I want someone to cuddle up next to; I want someone I can tell anything to; I want someone I can flatter on a regular basis. I <em>really, really, <strong>really</strong></em> want a girlfriend <strong><em>SO</em></strong> badly. I want a girlfriend so badly.

						Once again, I find myself in a difficult situation because of my inability to bring this journal up-to-date. Particularly since the beginning of this school year, I've been getting rather close to Tess and Linda. Although you should be familiar with the implications of that by the time you read this, as it stands currently, I haven't written anything of consequence regarding my feelings towards them. I had hoped that I would be able to just give them my journal and have everything explained at once, but my journal is a massive undertaking, and I have other things going on as well, so I'm still quite a long way away from finishing. However, this increasing closeness to Tess and Linda has come to a point that I have to put all my cards on the table before someone gets hurt. I'm pretty sure it was Wednesday that I decided (and told them) that I would tell them "something" by the end of the weekend either with a typed explanation or with me explaining things in person. I would greatly prefer the typed route since it would allow me to be more thorough and I could spare myself the awkward conversation, but I have to say something, and as I'm left with an ever-smaller amount of time to type everything I need to, it becomes increasingly likely that I have an extra-awkward conversation in my future. That won't stop me from trying to avoid it, though.

						Review (Typed Monday, September 16, 2019)
					</h2>
					<section>
						(I'd prefer that I put more care into wording this, but this is what you get.)
					</section>
					<section>
						As time has gone by, I've gotten to know Tess pretty well, and she's gotten to know me, too. Although she does a large number of strange things, they're all rather endearing, and she has perhaps a 90% chance of correctly guessing what I'm thinking despite the fact that I'm only giving her a blank stare. She's very kind, and shares many of my opinions and interests. Under ordinary circumstances, I'd be considering her a strong candidate for a potential relationship, but there's a problem: I don't feel that way towards her (it's hard to say whether that continues), and I know it's only because of her appearance. It's not like she's repulsive or anything, but I feel awful about it because I really don't think that would be the case if she looked like, say, Juliana. I really wanted to go out with Juliana and yet I think Tess beats her on compatibility with me on many levels. I've invested so much energy into not judging people by their appearance, so I especially hate how it resurfaces itself when it really matters.
					</section>
					<section>
						It also leaves me wondering what would happen in the future when whatever looks of my wife fade. I surely wouldn't divorce her, but would it end up weakening our bond? I don't disagree with the idea that it might be nice to be with Tess, but I can't start a relationship with her unless I can be fully invested in it. I hate being so superficial; This isn't how I want to run my life! I know all about people looking better the better you know them, but surely I would've felt something by now. I like how Tess grew her hair out, but if she gets it cut again, am I suddenly going to change my opinion of her? And what about Linda? Although she was fairly distant when we were getting to know each other, she's since gotten very friendly with me, and it's become significantly more difficult for me to see the small potential issues that I noticed earlier on, however, that doesn't mean they no longer exist. I feel like I'm trying to make Linda seem like the better option just so I don't have to think so hard about all of this. And what if I'm getting too anxious, and neither of them are a good option and/or there's someone else who would be better suited to me but who isn't as conveniently accessible? There's no winning here. At least I think I've been avoiding any situation where someone else's feelings would be on the line.
					</section>
					<section>
						How a person treats me has always been my number-one priority and the first thing I look for, and in pretty much every circumstance, I think I've been doing a fairly good job at staying true to that. Moreover, when it comes to relationships, although it would be naive of me to completely discount the influence of appearance on my feelings, I'm generally still rather receptive to the vast majority of people. However, ... although I don't want to say it because I really don't want to insult Tess, ... it didn't take long for me to realize that my unusual disinterest in someone seemingly so well suited to me was a result of not reaching a certain threshold. But I hardly know what I think anymore: I've run this through my mind so many times that it's getting hard to distinguish between what I feel and what I want to feel. For reasons only my instincts understand, Tess's change in hairstyle provided a significant boost to my evaluation of her, but I really don't know how that affects other things, and things are further obscured by the jokingly adversarial relationship we've developed (during which Linda typically teams up with me). Further complicating things is how Tess is rather cautious with imposing herself on people, so it's difficult for me to gauge how much she actually wants to be around me, but that's actually a good quality to have!
					</section>
					<section>
						Since I'm surely going to change this entry later, I might as well throw in how I feel about Linda. She's also very nice, and I like how she has a more (physically) active way of having fun with me. I was a little worried about her being too blunt and maybe a few other things, but I don't really see that much anymore, and it's hard for me to tell whether it's just being hidden, if I've gotten used to it, if only other people bring it out, or if it's since faded. I can say, however, that I really liked fighting and tickling her, but I know that's more a result of the close proximity it puts her to me than it is that I like expending my energy in that way. There were a number of times when she was provoking me into an attack, but I held myself back because I'm not dating her, and I'd enjoy it too much. As she's shared things about her past and things she struggles with, it's brought us even closer.
					</section>
					<section>
						I'm especially worried because, although I'm not certain, I think there's a very strong possibility that they're both interested in pursuing a relationship with me, and I don't know how I feel. I'm also worried that Tess might feel something towards me but will sell herself short because she doesn't want to create conflict. Moreover, there are things such as tickling that I don't think would be acceptable to do with both of them if I was going out with one of them. I've been getting too close to them, so I can't wait until I finish my journal before I tell them this stuff if I expect to not create a real problem.

						Review (Typed Monday, September 16, 2019)
					</h2>
					<section>
						Starting with a trip to the Science Center on May 29, Tess and Linda began stopping by my house. Although they had big plans for all the things they'd do with me, future trips (primarily a month later) focused on the kittens at my house and the board games at Linda's house. Especially when there were kittens at my house, Tess and Linda were determined to find as many opportunities as possible to visit my house; however, given how Tess has an hour drive to get to my house, Linda was in a better position to make frequent visits. <span class="elaborate obvious">Side note</span><aside data-heading="Side note">As it turns out, Linda lives in Caitlyn's neighborhood. I tried looking for her house when we drove there, but either we didn't pass by it, I don't recognize it anymore, or they changed the outside of their house because I didn't see it.</aside> The things is, though, I wouldn't let her. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm not very keen to have one-on-one time with girls when my dad has to know about it, so despite Linda's countless requests to visit my house, I would turn her down every time, and it would kill me because I'd love to have a visitor. I explained my dilemma to Linda and Tess, and they seemed to understand, but when I told Harper about it, she wasn't afraid to tell me how dumb it was. I couldn't help but wonder, though, whether there was more behind Linda's extreme insistence to visit my house than just wanting to see kittens. Kittens are a crowd-pleaser, so there's a good chance that that's really all it was, but she <em>really</em> wanted to see my kittens to the point that she would make legitimate requests to see them (right away) in the middle of the night. Maybe she just likes kittens that much, but I found it rather strange.
					</section>
					<section>
						Naturally, my dad took notice of the presence of girls who seemed to enjoy spending time with me. Although it was to a lesser degree than I might expect from how often he tells me I need a girlfriend, my dad once again began sizing them up and giving unsolicited advice. When I wouldn't tell him if I was beginning to like either of them (or anything else), he told me how "it better not be the fat one" and he then proceeded to tell me how "the other one is kind-of cute, but [I] can do a <em>lot</em> better than her". I never know how to feel about my dad's belief that I can get really good-looking girls because it seems like a complimentary thing to say, but I have conservative views on how good-looking I actually am (although I'll joke about being a stud plenty), and it always comes up in the context of my dad telling me how I need to prioritize appearance over personality in potential girfriends. Regardless, I would just wait for my dad to finish talking and then live my life as I would have if he hadn't said anything.
					</section>
					<section>
						Something else of note relating to Tess and Linda is how I began sending them encoded messages in early July. However, these messages weren't encoded like the ones I had them work on before: they were password-protected. Primarily as a means of putting personal messages in this journal without risking other people reading them, I had put together a program (as an extension of my <a href="https://coolprogramminguser.github.io/decoder/">Decoder</a>) which allowed me to convert text into emojis that relied on a password to determine their exact value. In effect, there was no real chance of determining what the messages said without the password (which I wasn't going to provide). But that begs the question of why I would want to send people messages that they can't read. Well, I think I've established that I'm not without a desire to have a girlfriend and to be able to do things such as shower them with flattery. As <a href="#Wednesday%2C%20January%2023%2C%202019" target="_self">my January 23<sup>rd</sup> entry</a> (and others) surely demonstrates, these feelings can build up and make me yearn for an outlet, but if I started saying exrta-nice things to girls, I would be setting them up to come to certain conclusions which I may or may not want them to come to. An easy way around that is to just make sure that they never know what I'm saying, and wouldn't it just so happen that I now had a means of accomplishing that. Consequentially, I decided to start flirting with Tess and Linda in that emoji code. Although I never said anything too crazy, there were times when I could lay it on pretty thick, and I loved it. Presumably, after reading this journal, the two of them would have a more thorough understanding of my motivations for the stuff I said in my encoded messages and would be less inclined to jump to conclusions, so when they asked whether they would ever get the password, I told them they would eventually as a secret reference to that time. In my misguided optimism about when I would finish my journal, however, I made the mistake of making Tess and Linda's password too easy; afterall, why would I have to put much effort into a password that's going to be revealed in a few weeks? (My goal was to finish by Kyra's birthday: July 30.) As such, I decided to make the password a simple description of the content: "flirting". Worse yet, due to an oversight in the way I had messages encoded, the first emoji was the same for every message with the same password, and it made it possible to determine the first letter of the password. <span class="elaborate obvious">Side note</span><aside data-heading="Side note"></aside> By August 2<sup>nd</sup>, Linda had figured out the first letter of the password, and Tess soon followed. I had to tell both of them to stop pursuing the password, and although they listened, it naturally piqued their interest. For a very brief period of time, I started putting the messages in our Snapchat group chat (named "Nuisances" by me), but I pretty much immediately regretted it due to the potential of feelings getting hurt when they could compare compliments; they're welcome to share their messages once they know what they are, but it needs to be their decision. I only went back to putting things in the group chat occasionally when I wanted to tell both of them the exact same thing. These messages continued all the way up to today (September 16), but now their future is uncertain because Tess and Linda will learn the password today. To end things, I'll give you sample messages to satisfy your curiosity:
