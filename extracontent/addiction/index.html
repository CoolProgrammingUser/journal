				Although this would ordinarily contain a more generic introduction, considering how I'm already altering things to make sure I cover everything in just this section of the website, I might as well address you directly, Harper. First off, I'd like to ask that you not skim over any of this. There may be times when I may seem to be rattling on about a whole lot of nothing (like this), but I use that rattling to develop a fuller picture of what's going on, and it also often serves to soften the important parts I have to say. I know it can be frustrating when I take forever to get to the point (also like this), but it would put me more at ease if I knew you were carefully considering what I had to say. Another thing I'd like to ask is that you don't talk to me until you've finished reading all that you plan to. Although it seems relatively unlikely to happen since this isn't excessively long (depending on your definition of "long"), if you should feel compelled to comment on anything or ask a question, just wait until the end; I don't want to have the process of figuring out what you think of me dragged out any longer than it needs to be. Naturally, you may think that that means you should tell me what you think as early as possible, but if it's good, I'd worry that you'd change your mind by the end, and if it's bad, I'd worry that talking to me would prevent you from getting to a part that redeemed me.
