			<section>
				First off, I think you're entitled to know that I'm not actually not going to say what the problem is in this section, but I still think this is worth reading. I know that you're surely dying of curiosity by now, but I don't want to just jump into saying what it is without first making sure that you have a thorough understanding of things. I'd like to ask that you not skim over any of this. There may be times when I may seem to be rattling on about a whole lot of nothing (like this), but I use that rattling to develop a fuller picture of what's going on, and it also often serves to soften the important parts I have to say. I know it can be frustrating when I take forever to get to the point (also like this), but it would put me more at ease if I knew you were carefully considering what I had to say. Another thing I'd like to ask is that you don't talk to me until you've finished reading all that you plan to. Although it seems relatively unlikely to happen since this isn't excessively long (depending on your definition of "long"), if you should feel compelled to comment on anything or ask a question, just wait until the end; I don't want to have the process of figuring out what you think of me dragged out any longer than it needs to be. Naturally, you may think that that means you should tell me what you think as early as possible, but if it's good, I'd worry that you'd change your mind by the end, and if it's bad, I'd worry that talking to me would prevent you from getting to a part that redeemed me. Now that I've thoroughly dragged this out, I'll tell you that basically everything worth reading about is in the Entries section, accessible through the tab on the left which opens up the contents. It's worth noting that the entries don't necessarily flow from one to the next, and I sometimes repeat what I say or change my mind. Also, I occasionally make references to parts of my life that aren't addressed here; you may find the background information below helpful in clearing some of that up.

			<h3>
				p05
			</h3>
			<section>
				This was my first girlfriend who I went out with during my sophomore year of high school. She helped me in a time when I was exceptionally lonely, and we got along really well. I loved her so much, and I gave her my journal to read at one point (my journal didn't have anything about this at the time), but eventually we broke up. When I couldn't recieve enough attention from her and I faced returning to the miserable loneliness I had experienced before, I forced myself to be more outgoing and it changed my life. What also changed my life was how p05 kept distancing herself ever farther from me until we were no longer talking. I can't be sure why it happened, but my best guess is that I "smothered" her despite my extensive efforts to avoid exactly that. For the rest of my time in high school, I would have to see her nearly every day and watch her befriend my newly established friend-group. I made a number of attempts to correct things over those years (but not so many that it would be counterproductive), but I wasn't successful. I had to reevaluate what I could expect from a relationship and implement safegaurds to help ensure that such a series of events wasn't as likely to occur again.

			<h3>
				p03
			</h3>
			<section>
				Although I recognized her since the beginning of freshman year, I only really got to know p03 in my senior year of high school. She was the typical overacheiver, and she shared nearly all of my classes. It was when she sat next to me in Psychology because I was one of the few people in the class she "didn't dislike" that we started talking. As I got to know her, I came to realize that she had a thinking process that paralleled mine in a way I've only experienced with one other person (not p05). She was smart, responsible, understanding, deliberative, and just an overall great person to be around. Admittedly, I would have liked to have gone out with her, but she was in a relationship for the majority of the time I knew her (with a person I knew), and she wasn't interested anyway. That didn't stop us from being close friends, though. However, despite that, I had become paranoid since my relationship with p05 had fallen apart, so I was reluctant to open up. p03 tried to coax some things out of me, and eventually I felt bad enough for shutting her out that I wrote her at least one note explaining my reservations. Slowly, I began to trust her more, and in the meantime (in between our playful arguing), she would demonstrate her kindness in ways such as being a primary organizer of a "surprise" birthday party. Towards the end of senior year, I decided that I had formed a strong enough bond with p03 to make her the second person to read my journal. Regrettably, I didn't have much luck on adequately catching up on the very important past few years, but I knew I'd never be able to fully trust her if she didn't know about the topic addressed here, so I made sure that part was included. It's after I recieve back the notebooks containing my journal that the Entries section picks up.

			<h3>
				Miscellaneous
			</h3>
			<section>
				In at least one place, I reference a general lack of religion. This would rank #2 on my list of things I don't want to tell people, but considering how it doesn't have its own section of a website devoted to it, I think you can tell that I'm not quite as anxious about it. I could, however, discuss this in great length, but nobody has time for that. Just don't be surprised.

			<section>
				Depending on what you look at, you may see a reference to candy cane grams. Before Christmas during my senior year of high school, I wrote a letter to each of my closest friends and had it sent to them with candy through the school's candy cane gram fundraiser. The letters took me about a solid week of constant work through the night to finish, and they discussed how much I appreciated them (which isn't something I necessarily make clear normally).

				If there's other information you're wondering about, you'll just have to ask me about it (after finishing reading). I don't have time to address everything, and not everyone will have the same gaps in knowledge when they get here.
