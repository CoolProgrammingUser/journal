				<section>
					And just like that, I destroyed another friendship.
				</section>
				<section>
					Since today is my last day of high school, I was getting worried about Sarah returning this journal in time as the day neared. Sarah is a binge reader, so I didn't think it would take her too long to read this; I figured she must be writing in here (I sort-of knew that Caitlyn wouldn't write in here because she'd never be able to settle on something perfect enough, but I thought I'd be able to get Sarah to write something). I was wrong. Maybe Sarah had a lot of work to do, or maybe she wanted to take her time, or maybe she just slacked off in giving it back to me. As you'll see in a second, another possibility is that she wanted to hold off until she wouldn't see me again (since seniors don't have to come to school during the time of their exempted final, Sarah didn't have any classes with me today). Regardless of the reason, I recieved my notebooks back yesterday at the end of the day. Later on, I texted her saying how she was killing me by not writing anything.
				</section>
				<section>
					In order to fully understand her response, I first need to tell you about the part of my journal I got rid of. I had been hoping to put all the things I'm ashamed of in one entry (following this one), but after much consideration, I decided to put the worst one (the one I wrote) here. I don't want to talk about this any more than I absolutely have to, so I'm going to say all that I plan to now. This version will be much more brief than the original one. It was longer initially because I felt the need to come completely clean <span class="elaborate obvious" data-date="2019/2/24">Future</span><aside data-heading="Reevaluation">Upon further consideration, I've come to believe that my true motivations lie in my desire for acceptance. Since I won't give myself acceptance, I felt compelled to seek it elsewhere, but I wouldn't believe that acceptance unless they knew everything. Although realizing this hasn't negated the feeling, it's helped me be more in control of it.</aside>, but in retrospect, I think it was too graphic, hence getting rid of it. I feel absolutely terrible about it, and I only write it because I have to know that the people I get close to won't abandon me if they should ever find out. I hope you don't think too harshly of me.
				</section>
				<section>
					You see... the thing is... I masturbate. <span class="elaborate">It started accidentally</span> in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and has persisted despite my numerous, variably successful attempts to stop.
					<aside data-heading="Explanation"></aside>
					It continues because it feels good, somewhat inhibits my reasoning, doesn't really have any negative consequences, and doesn't provide me with a logical reason to stop which would <span style="text-decoration:line-through">most certainly</span> <span class="circle">possibly</span> allow me to put an end to it (societal alienation doesn't count as a logical reason although it's definitely enough to make me feel awful about it). (I'd say the first reason and maybe the second one are the biggest, both of which are highly reminiscent of a drug addiction.) My lowest moment came when a combination of curiosity and impaired reasoning caused me to watch a pornographic video. I was so horrified by how far I'd gone that I never did it again. I don't want to take this weakness along with me to college, but I don't know what I'm going to do.
				</section>
				<section>
					With this in mind, Sarah's responding text was as follows: "Well I didn't read all of it and I found it kind of gross and offensive and didn't really even want to talk to you. So you're lucky I didn't write something, honestly." I told her how sorry I was, and she told me it was fine, but I said how I wasn't so sure about that. She said how it didn't really affect our relationship since we weren't going to stay friends much longer because school was ending. I continued apologizing and asked if she at least read the nice things I said about her. She responded by saying, "Try not to worry about it, really, I'll move on from it I just didn't appreciate it and I considered wearing red lipstick for an entire week and also I was just a little bit annoyed that you basically just kept telling me to ask you stuff when I think that if you want to talk about something you should bring it up with someone because you're a high school senior." I didn't think I was being mean by slightly critiquing her appearance in between complimenting it, and I'm not proud of having such a hard time opening up to people. Maybe she was just put in a bad mood because of the first part, but then again, maybe not. From there she started telling me all about how she doesn't think I'm "not good enough for her," just that we're different people who don't click in that way. She also said how being friends is hard to manage occasionally (which I didn't know about or I would have put a stop to), and she told me how she just likes Jared <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span><aside>In any other circumstances besides this one, this would be a huge deal. Obviously, I knew Jared, and he was the only other person besides Sarah who I thought shared my way of thinking (although it was slightly different). Once Sarah told me her thoughts on Jared, it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world that they were perfect for each other, and I would have been more than happy to play matchmaker as Sarah is so fond of doing. I may be the only person besides her best friend (presumably) who knows about this.</aside>. Sarah even said how I'm an amazing person and how I'll find someone that's perfect for me. I had always known that her not liking me more than a friend wasn't anything personal, but I was kind-of thrown off balance by the shift in conversation. After she told me how she didn't want me to be down on myself just because she had a crush on someone else, I told her how that was the last thing I was worried about at that point. She followed that up by saying how she thought everything was fine right now, but I didn't share her sentiments. She told me how she thought I messed up, but sometimes you just have to get over it; I'd be moving to a different state (Massachusetts for college), and it won't matter in a year; it'll be fine. I told her how it's not fine if I have to go to another state for things to be okay, but she insisted that I not worry. I continued worrying, and she eventually admitted that she probably won't talk to me directly because she feels extremely awkward around me now. She asked me to quit apologizing when I kept saying how sorry I was, but it didn't really work. After this went on for a little while longer, the conversation came to an end. Some time went by, and I thought I'd ask her if we'd ever text again. She said that she didn't particularly plan on it, so I wanted to say one last thing to her: "Well, I want you to know that I appreciated the friendship we had, and I'm sorry things turned out this way. I'll miss you very much." Sarah ended things with a "Well thank you" ... And so concluded yet another friendship. I cried.

				<section>
					I don't know how I can keep going on like this. Especially since my time of extreme lonliness, my relationships with others mean everything to me, and yet the most important people in my life have left me with nothing but intense emotional pain. I was just barely starting to get over losing Caitlyn, and now I have to find some way of dealing with losing Sarah. Do I have to be in a constant state of heart ache? If I had someone to fall back on, maybe things wouldn't be so bad because I'd have a source of support in the rough times, but I don't have anyone. I get along with an enormous amount of people, but I always keep up a barrier just in case something should go wrong. Because of this barrier, people can only get so close to me, and I find myself without anyone to turn to when hard times arrive. The only people ever allowed beyond this fortification have just reinforced the reason for its existence. How am I ever supposed to learn to let people in if I'm always punished for it?
				</section>
				<section>
					I would have thought that, after reading this journal, Sarah would have developed a greater sympathy for me, but apparently I was mistaken. I may have my short-comings, and I assure you, I feel terrible about them, but do I have to be perfect to be accepted? Sarah is one of the mildest, most rational people I know and is quite nice and accepting; am I really so awful that even she doesn't want anything to do with me? Is it just the one thing that turned her against me? Couldn't she tell how horrible I feel about it? Is it that it was too long? Would she react the same way now? Do I have to sacrifice another friend to find out? Is there any way of mentioning it without alienating her? What could I have done to prevent this from happening? Is there any way I can make things right? Surely she read how things between Caitlyn and me took a turn for the worst. Doesn't she see how she's making me relive that? Doesn't she know how hard this is on me? Doesn't she even care?
				</section>
				<section>
					Today was supposed to be a day of taking in the last of my time in high school while sentimentally contemplating how much I'll miss everything and everyone. Instead, I spent the day wallowing in misery while, at one point, silently crying (not that anyone noticed). Not only do I feel bad for how things went between Sarah and me but I also feel bad for not [spending more time with] and [properly missing] the friends I have left. To be honest, though, I'm probably not taking this as hard as the first time around: I've had so much practice suppressing despairing feelings, and I never really let Sarah all the way in because I was scared of this exact thing happening. Furthermore, there comes a point when you don't even know how to feel any worse, and I think that point is lower ever since my culmination of self-hatred (which I still haven't talked about). However, that's not to say that I don't still feel terrible. I'm just getting exhausted from so much pain.
				</section>
				<section>
					Ironically enough, the only people who have been consistently there for me are my parents. If I didn't know I'd be harassed indefinitely after giving them any sort of insight into my life, I'd be inclined to tell them all sorts of things because at least they won't leave me.
				</section>
				<section>
					I just don't want to have to keep hoping that my own strength will pull me through. I want to have someone I can confide in and who I know will be there to support me or at least gently explain their reservations. My parents will be there for me and Sarah will gently explain her reservations (I don't think I've ever been so politely told to get lost), but each of them are missing something. How much longer will I have to wait before I can have that sort of security?

				<section>
					As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.
				</section>
				<section>
					I <strong>hate</strong> my addiction. I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between Sarah and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). Sarah is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

					Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the large number of my pants that were a little too tight for me. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span><aside>They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance. Luckily, I got some new pants this past summer or else even more of them would be a little too tight.</aside> If I were a girl, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the construction of my body, I'm predisposed to encountering issues. In particular, random (or non-random) fluctuations in my hormone levels are capable of producing an obstruction to comfortable sitting. With tighter pants, it's possible for that uncomfortableness to border on painfulness as happened on Tuesday. (This doesn't happen very often or else I would demand new pants from my parents.) Naturally, my corrupted mind saw this as an opportunity to entertain my addiction, but I'm not one to willingly torture myself, so I took measures to prevent it. Of those measures, the most effective one was a persuasive essay I had begun writing in an effort to call attention to my motivations for discontinuing this activity when I'm not thinking clearly. Even though it isn't finished, as has happened every other time I read it, my urges were replaced with intense disappointment for what my life had become. However, I still couldn't sit. In order to adequately rectify the situation, I had to go to the bathroom, but I ended up spending the majority of my time there crying. (I bet you were starting to think I did something else.) Luckily, the place was pretty deserted, so I didn't have to worry about anyone hearing me. I usually try to occupy my mind with more manageable thoughts, but this time, the full force of what a disgusting undisciplined disappointment I am really set in. For a good 20 minutes, I stood around in there thoroughly sobbing, banging my head against the side of the stall, and despairing over my future (and past and present). Eventually, though, I collected myself and attempted to be productive.
				</section>
				<section>
					Reading this, you may think that I should have been happy that I scored a victory, but the thing you overlook is that I've scored plenty of victories in the past, and yet the problem remains. I'd like to think that the persuasive essay I wrote will continue to keep my addiction at bay, but I have no way of being sure of that. I'm just so tired of being miserable; I want it to stop. If I could take some magical pill to put an end to my addiction, I'd do it in a heartbeat. More drastic than that, I've given some serious thought to, at some point in the future after having kids, effectively having myself neutered. I just hate this so much. It's been some time now since I decided that I may not be able to resolve this on my own, but who can I tell? My parents who will exacerbate the situation? My friends who will leave me? One of the many organizations established to help with such an addiction? Society has made it very clear that this isn't something that's okay to talk about, and I definitely feel the pressure to conform. The Internet, however, seems to have a completely different point-of-view. When you look up how to stop an addiction such as mine, you get two kinds of results: ones that tell you you don't need to stop, and ones that tell you you should just trust in God. As you might imagine, I don't find either of those results very helpful. Those results, though, suggest an entirely different distribution of opinions than I'm familiar with, and I'm skeptical of their accuracy. Even if 5% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad, I still want to stop for that other 95%; even if 25% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad and another 50% can accept me, there's still that other 25% and that 50% surely wouldn't think of me as being as virtuous as they thought before; even if 100% of the population suddenly decided that my addiction is rather insignificant, it would still be quite some time before I could move past the disgust that has been so thoroughly instilled in me. I can't give definite numbers to who will think what, but I don't think I have the greatest odds, especially among the people I get to know. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span>
					<aside data-heading="Explanation">Although I'm not saying other people are inferior or that I only associate with certain people, I do have a tendency to form stronger bonds with the type of people who are generally thought of as meeting higher academic and moral standards, but it's because they meet those standards that I'm worried that I'll no longer seem like the person they want to be around.</aside>
					As I contemplate giving this journal to my closest friends once it's finished, I'm worried about what will happen if this is still an issue: People may be able to look past something that affected me <em>in the past</em>, but what will they think if it's still going on? I'd like to have the previously written part of my journal digitized by the end of the summer and have the events since then caught up by winter break. That only gives me a limited window to resolve this, especially if I would need at least a month or so free from this to have any sort of certainty that it's gone. (I've gone about a year free from it before, so a month is an absolute minimum.) I just want this to be over. I'm so tired of feeling awful. I want my life back.

					There's a 0% chance that I'm going to finish this today, but I've been putting off starting this for far too long, and if I wait for a convenient time, my emotions will subside, and I'll want to spend my time doing other things; that's already starting to be true.<note-><div><div>But I have reason to believe that it won't happen.</div></div></note-> I think the easiest way to cover everything is to just start at the beginning of the process and describe my thoughts along the way, all while trying to keep repulsive details to a minimum.
				</section>
				<section>
					It always starts after I've been eased into a sense of security. I've gone a long time without succumbing; I haven't really been thinking about any of this much at all; As a matter of fact, investing all of that energy into such an activity seems like a rather taxing experience: it's not worth it. Then, like a hawk swooping in for the kill, the activity suddenly doesn't seem so taxing anymore. Maybe it was caused by the lyrics of a song; maybe it was caused by suspicious activities happening in a neighboring room; maybe it was just the result of a random fluctuation of hormones. Sometimes, it's not even anything that has an immediately noticeable effect. Regardless, the seed has been sown. I begin to become curious about what I would have considered dull not too long ago. I think about all kinds of things all the time; maybe I could let my mind wander a little bit this time as well... BUT WAIT! I've been through this before! I know where this is going. I've put so much time and energy into overcoming this addiction, and I'm on a streak right now. I've been making myself miserable over this for years; it's about time that I did myself a service and put an end to this... But I'm not thinking about anything all that bad right now. I know I don't want to get carried away, but a little fantasizing never hurt anyone... But wait. I've been through this before. My addiction tries to mask itself as innocent idle considerations, but I know the truth: it's a slippery slope leading into a pit of dispair. I can't do this to myself... But I'm actually kind-of interested in what I'm thinking about; it's a rather stimulating course of thought. I think I'll be okay... <span style="font-size:.75rem">But wait. I've been through this before. I know where I'm headed, and I'm lying to myself to get there</span>... I don't know why I don't get caught up in this more often: it's pretty fun to play out this scenario in my head... <span style="font-size:.5rem">But wait. I've been through this before</span>... Huh. I've never considered that exact aspect before... <span style="font-size:.25rem">But wait</span>..................

					And then I'm no longer in control. It doesn't matter what other people would think; It doesn't matter how much homework I have; it doesn't matter what time of night it is; it doesn't even matter if I was literally just starting to get over the guilt of a previous failure. There's only one thing that I care about, and it's not even myself. [Unfinished] <!---->

				<section>
					I don't know how I can keep going on like this. No matter what I do, the same thing keeps happening over and over again. I like to think that I'm at least on the path towards some kind of resolution, but I've been trying to convince myself of that for years, and I haven't seen any results. I was thinking about how long this has been going on, and I was shocked when I finally put a number to it: about 9 years. This has been a constant struggle for nearly half of my life. If you only count what I remember, I have more memories of my life with this problem than I do without it. When you've been dealing with the same problem for 9 years, you begin to wonder if there will ever be a solution. I've tried so many things to get me to stop, but it's never good enough. For a long time I thought that, if I could just think of a logical reason to stop (based on evidence, not what people happen to believe), I would be able to end this. When I lost Sarah, I thought I had come up with a reason: This plainly had me addicted, and addictions are bad. Afterall, anyone who experiences a loss like that and then goes back to participating in the thing that drove them away must have a problem. However, my addiction wouldn't give up so easily: Soon enough, I was thinking about how other things exhibited addictive qualities such as eating and spending time with people. (The desire for them increases the longer you go without them, and you feel good when you give in.) This led me to a futile attempt to determine what's okay to be addicted to and what the meaning of life is. Before I knew it, I was back at square one. Time went by, and maybe about a year ago, I thought I figured it out again: It didn't matter whether my addiction should be condemned or not; the fact remains that it is, and I'll never be happy while this is holding me hostage. Not only did this provide a solid line of reasoning (which I should have thought of long ago), but it also conveniently circumvented my difficulties reconciling my addiction and its shared variety. (If the only thing that mattered was what people thought, it didn't really matter if I considered the two activities to be essentially the same.) It was at this point that I had to face the reality that my belief that logic would allow me to direct my actions was really just a hopeful fantasy serving to hinder my identification of the true issue. More recently (maybe before winter break), I found myself miserable and sleep-deprived once again when I should have been doing homework or sleeping, and it occurred to me that I have absolutely no control over my addiction, and it's destroying my life. This isn't a particularly new thought, but that time, it really sunk in that my addiction is calling <em>all</em> the shots, and it's <em>completely</em> destroying my life. Moreover, I finally accepted that I'm completely incapable of making a sound decision when my addiction is trying to assert itself. Accompanying that was the evaluation that <em>both</em> varieties of my addiction would produce the same results and so both should be avoided. Realizing that this could cause problems in marriage, I conceded that such activities could be planned for specific times which would minimize the destructive influence; however, stopping altogether would make things easier since, the longer I resist my addiction, the easier it is to do so. This line of reasoning has the added benefits of reconciling my addiction with its shared variety and reinforcing the need to rely on automatic forms of resistance instead of evaluating things on the fly. As you surely guessed, though, this still didn't prove to be infallible. [Unfinished] <!---->

					There were going to be a lot of things for me to say, but I seriously can't afford to invest any more time in this. (Depending on where this is when you read it, it may be worth noting that this used to be in the section of the website devoted to my addiction.) I was hoping to at least say some things about Harper, but I'll miss class if I do that, and I have many other academic obligations that would make it irresponsible for me to continue working on this later. (By the way, the class I would be missing is on the 26<sup>th</sup>; I've been working on this through the night.)

						If I were to go with my typical policy of dating entries, this would still be May 1<sup>st</sup> (since it's the early-morning hours), but I wanted to keep these thoughts separate from the previous ones. Naturally, I don't have time for this, but... there is no rationalization. My life is so messed up.
					</section>
					<section>
						As much as I try to supress it, there are times when I can't escape my innate desire to share my addiction with someone; and I don't mean with words. The primary reason life persists is because it reproduces, so it only makes sense for living things to be designed with such aspirations built-in. Being a living thing, that naturally applies to me, but being an intelligent living thing, I try to have my life mean more than that, and being a social living thing, I'm subject to societal pressures. It's blatantly obvious that those last two points have brought me into significant conflict with the urges resulting from the first one.
					</section>
					<section>
						Man, I don't have time for this! I have a large amount of important homework due, and yet I find myself typing here.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, the point I'm trying to get at is that I generally place my addiction into it's own category, separate from the reproductive activities which it's surely trying to promote, but increasingly (though still infrequently), I've found myself thinking beyond the basic pleasure response to the idea that I'd very much like to partake in a shared addiction. I know I'm by no means the only one to feel that way, and as a matter of fact, at this stage in people's lives, there's only an extremely small percentage of people who can say that they haven't done the actual act (by my estimate, there's perhaps around 10 or less people who fall into that category, and that's among everyone I know), but discomfort about the topic has been too firmly entrenched into my mind, and I can't help but feel like succombing to the idea of wanting to have a physically intimate relationship with someone else would be reaching a new low. Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said the desire didn't exist.

When transferring my phone service over, a customer-service representative called to make sure that everything was working properly. They had asked me whether I had tested making a call, and I told them "yes" even though I had only tested texting by that time. I tested calling soon afterwards (and ended up talking to Logan forever), but I can't cut that event out of my life and place it further back in time. I know this is a rather trivial incident, but I take my adherence to truth very seriously, and I don't like anything which compromises that. I'm wondering, however, whether I should continue mentioning such inconsequential slip-ups. I don't want to hide anything from anyone, but everything else in my life has to reach a certain level of importance before it's worthy of being mentioned; why shouldn't that apply to this as well? I suppose only time will tell.</aside>

						Something I'm worried about, though, is the potential of having fantasies with people I know. Up to this point, I've prevented myself from thinking such things because of how much I've reviled the idea, but depending on the circumstances, playful moments I have with girls can later tempt me to imagine being playful with them in a different environment. I've compromised so many other principles in pursuit of my addiction; is it just a matter of time until I compromise this one? Another thought I've been resisting is that my desire for a girlfriend is actually just a manifestation of my desire to more effectively satisfy my addiction. I have no doubt that the same hormones are responsible for both feelings, but I haven't yet given up on the idea that my desire for a girlfriend is significantly influenced by a more general desire for close companionship. Regardless, I do a fairly thorough job of separating my emotional needs from my instinctual drives, so I generally don't think of them together. But my instinctual drives continue to attempt to assert themselves, and I worry that my friends will unwittingly find themselves much more involved than they want to be. This has become particularly relevant with getting to know Harper. As you know, the events that transpired between us brought us very close to each other, and although I still wouldn't say that I'm convinced it would be a good idea for us to go out (especially since it increasingly seems like she isn't interested), I sincerely love her. When that's combined how freely she's willing to share her body with guys, the less innocent parts of me begin to see potential. I really don't want to say so, but largely because of my aversion to mentioning it, I have to admit that there have been a few times when I thought it would be rather nice to pursue a much higher level of intimacy with Harper. Naturally, I don't have any intention of taking advantage of her like that, and the few times I've thought that are pretty much exclusively in the past, but I feel like it's inevitable that such thoughts will return in relation to someone at some point. That being said, it's actually very likely that, if I have the right relationship with the person, they'll <em>want</em> me to think that about them. This brings up another issue: how would I handle a situation like that? Although I somehow manage to feel pressured to refrain from going all the way with a girl until marriage, among my generation at this point in time, it's essentially unquestioned that going out with someone will progress to that point within a relatively short period of time. However, I've considered an insistance of that before marriage to be one of my only deal-breakers. But then the question arises: if I would want the same thing as this hypothetical girl and I'd likely marry them eventually anyway by that point, why should I call things off after such a (hardline) request? Although I don't mean to insult her, Harper's lifestyle has gone a long way towards helping me establish the notion that I don't have to be so perfect all the time. Don't get me wrong: thinking that I don't have to be so perfect all the time is a good thing to inspire, but that also extends to things like this situation. Aiding that is my recent attainment of drinking age: I may choose to say this earlier, but after I had realized that I had successfully never drank underage, I was overcome by this sickeningly hollow feeling. Despite having stayed true to what I've always aspired to do (including not drinking on my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday), I couldn't help but feel like all it proved was that I was a stickler for the rules and that people should continue expecting me to be the ideal person. Especially if I have to make an effort to avoid it, I think there's a very legitimate possibility that the victory of waiting until marriage will seem just as hollow. I don't know if I can compromise on that, though: I've tried imagining what it would be like (and I'm typically very good at predicting my behavior), and I can only honestly see myself becoming overwhelmed with guilt (but becoming thoroughly addicted if I followed through). Luckily, I don't have to face this problem right now, but if and when my wish for a girlfriend is granted, I'm not sure how things are going to play out.

						Since I seemed to have gotten through all of this without ever specifying my motivation for typing it in the first place, I'll say that my addiction is relentless, and my increasing desire to involve someone else makes it all the worse. My dad has told me a number of times (when I was younger) that, soon enough, physically intimate activities would be all I could think about; although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's <em>all</em> I think about, it has definitely become a prevalent force in my life. (It doesn't help that I'm constantly surrounded by it, either.) Moreover, my addiction is completely indifferent to my emotions, and it will attempt to reassert itself even if I had been wallowing in despair over it literally just hours (or less) before.

						Although this is surely old news to you, my addiction is messing up my life. As I may have said before and as is the case for most things, my addictive tendencies come in waves, and I'm in a big one right now. I've been demonstrating considerably less control over my behavior, and it's proving to be a big issue considering how the year is coming to a close (and a lot of stuff is becoming due). Take today for instance: Because I lack even a basic desire to control myself, I was left with mere minutes to submit an assignment online for my Chemistry lab (which I'm in jeopardy of failing). Luckily, it was a pretty easy assignment, and I was able to throw something halfway decent together seconds before the deadline passed. At the same time, though, because it was such an easy assignment, it's extremely frustrating that it came down to this. Worse than that, I have a take-home final which I haven't even started due in a matter of hours, and I'm not even planning on getting to work on it immediately (because I'm typing in here and I still need to take a shower since I fell asleep at my computer again last night). But the fun doesn't end there: Although I woke up early enough to both take a shower and get breakfast, I did neither because of my addiction (and something else must have happened too). Moreover, Tess invited me to eat lunch with her and Tiffany, but because of the things going on, I don't think I have time to do so. Even more over, I was going to go to Subway for lunch today to splurge and pay for everyone else's meals with my left-over flex dollars, but now I don't have time for that, and the more I put it off, the less likely there will be stuff left to splurge on and the less likely people will want to conserve their meals and accept my payment. And this is just one example of how my life is crumbling around me. I really don't want to admit to it, but when Harper visited on Saturday (depending on how I order the entries in the end, you may find this event surprising), despite how I <em>really</em> wanted to greet her as she entered the Towers complex, I ended up needing to catch up with her later because of a preoccupation with my addiction. My life is so messed up.

						But I want to share my addiction with a girl so badly. This is actually the second time that I've considered mentioning this (more than an occasional reference), but I decided against it last time because I didn't want to risk becoming too obscene and regretting it when I'm thinking more clearly later. Really, none of that reasoning has changed, but somehow, feeling the need to say something about it for the second time seems to justify its mention. I don't think I can get into much detail because, even though this entry is currently in a section of its own, I'm still terrified of losing all of my friends. However, I can say that, at this particular moment, my desire to partake in reproductive activities is exceptionally intense. It doesn't help that I continue finding more effective ways of entertaining that desire. I may still be using rather formal language to address my feelings on this subject, but if you were to listen in on my mind, you'd quickly discover that my thoughts are anything but formal. I'd very much like to get to know a girl on an extremely intimate level. Imagine my rant about how much I want a girlfriend applying to this. I'm sure you're thinking, though, that it really did apply to this; I maintain, however, that despite an essentially identical biochemical motivation, my mind generally groups those two things separately. I'd be lying, though, if I told you that didn't recognize the potential of a girlfriend providing more than just companionship. However, that goes back to my last entry on this topic: Could I really take things all the way with my girlfriend before marriage and not feel guilty about it afterwards? Although I'm surely not in a state of mind to provide reliable insight on the answer right now, I'm currently inclined to say "yes". I continually become more desensitized in this area, so could it be that I'm slowly moving in the direction of actually believing that or is it just that I can't accurately forsee the consequences at this time? (Coming back to fill in an answer at a later time could resolve this nicely for you, but it's not worth it; you can wonder just like I am right now.) The very fact that I currently might believe that I'd be okay with getting physical with my girlfriend, though, introduces a serious problem: What if I can convince myself of that when the opportunity arises, but it turns out not to be true? In the event that such an opportunity arose, there would be many chances for me to change my mind, and it's not uncommon that I convince myself that I'm braver than I actually am, so there's still a very good chance that I would back out of it, but as I try to consider what I would do if I had a girlfriend who was prompting me to satisfy her desires as well as mine... I don't know... Maybe I wouldn't do it. But I'd want to so badly. I don't know. I'm almost wanting to convince myself that I'd follow through because I want it so badly, and there's no better way of placating myself than to get intimate with a girl, especially one that I loved. One thing I can say for sure, though, is that if I did it once, it would unquestionably become a regular occurence: One of the main things holding me back is the idea that I'm on a long streak, and I shouldn't break it; if I indulged even once, though, my thought process would be, "Well, I already lost the 'glory' of waiting until marriage, what difference does it make what I do now?" That makes it especially imperative that I not make the wrong decision. However, depending on the circumstances, it could get very difficult to determine what the right decision would be. For example: Say I had a gorgeous long-time girlfriend who was more loving than anyone else I knew. Maybe one day she decides that she wants to take things to the next level with me, but I decline. She's polite about it and tries to wait until I'm ready, but soon enough she's saying that she needs to be able to make love with her boyfriend for her to feel completely connected to him, and if I can't offer that, she thinks she might have to move on. Given that I'd actually be more than happy to resolve that for her and that I'd surely love her deeply and be very upset if she left, I legitimately don't know what I'd do. If she was inconsiderate about it, I'd probably stick with my principles and tell myself that I should wait for a girlfriend that cares more about my feelings; if she was nice about it, though, and we were really that close... I don't know; I'd have a really hard time countering the argument that it doesn't matter if we're surely going to get married anyway. It's entirely possible that I would give in. But is that wrong? I suspect that there's hardly a person alive (especially anywhere near my age) who would have a problem with a serious couple getting intimate with each other. Moreover, that's typically the <em>expectation</em>. In my quest for perfection, I end up acquiring traditional aversions which may no longer have a place in the definition of perfection. Although my general opinion of my addiction is that I hate it, when I'm in the midst of it, I don't dislike it any more than I would trying to program a super awesome game. More than that, I actually want to become more thoroughly engrossed in it. It's not until the feeling subsides that it really hits me that I just wasted hours on my addiction when I should have been doing something such as finishing my final. I really want to share my addiction so badly, though... Man, I want to be that close to a girl; I want to make a girl feel that good; I want to experience that kind of absolute bliss; I just want it so much.

						As I've mentioned before, it's not uncommon for me to wonder about just how much I can say about topics related to my addiction. As you've surely noticed, addressing these things concerns me so much that I do everything I can to avoid even saying the words which stand for these ideas. Not only do I worry about losing my perceived sense of dignified maturity but I also have the very real fear of disgusting people by providing too many details. I don't need to remind you about what happened with Sarah, but even if that hadn't happened, I've acquired certain expectations of people's reactions, and it's very easy for me to see people getting overwhelmed by hidden animalistic side; that's not to mention the fact that I have my own extremely hypocritical (though supressed) disgust of people partaking in similar activities. Thinking back to my high school days, I can remember how Brandi, Mary, and their friends would shamelessly discuss an endless variety of explicit topics, and they would never be subjected to sideways glances or people avoiding them (relatively speaking), so you may be led to believe that my fears are unfounded; however, besides that fact that they're girls and are therefore subject to a different set of expectaions, I know that not everyone is like them, and even if they were, I still couldn't be sure about topics not discussed even by them (such as an addiction like my own). From a purely probablistic standpoint, there must be people who don't care about any of this (and having Harper stand by me really helps dimminish the pessimism I have about that), but I can't get over the feeling that there will come a point when people can't stand it anymore. I like to think that dispersing these entries throughout my journal and being cautious about my word choice helps keep things below that threshold, but still the feeling persists. An important principle of this journal is to not hold back on any aspect of my life, and I stay true to that in all other things, but when it comes to anything even remotely involving my reproductive system, it's hard for me to say whether I'm still doing that ideal justice. For the record, I'm definitely addressing the most essential parts (I could never be at peace otherwise), but when it comes to things that only moderately affect my life, it's rather common that I feel that I need to keep it to myself. I know you've seen me talk about some very frivolous stuff, so you would think that something that moderately affects my life would definitely make the cut, but I have significantly higher standards when it comes to areas such as these. These standards aren't for myself, though; they're for others: I legitimately think that people don't want to hear about stuff like that. In a diary not meant for other people, I may dig into these things thoroughly, but I need to keep my audience in mind while composing this. At the same time, though, I know there's no way that I'm the only one experiencing these things, and part of me says that I should use this as an opportunity to show other people that they're not alone and maybe help provide them with some direction, but the fear... I'm not sure if there's any way of getting over this besides a <em>lot</em> of people reading this and giving positive, or at least neutral, feedback. I likely would have used this time to express my frustration about how certain extremely common changes in bloodflow result in a near-impossibility of comfortable sitting, but I'm inclined to believe that anything beyond that brief summary would be inappropriate for me to discuss. Instead, I thought I'd describe the internal struggle I have every time I contemplate expanding on this subject... Well, that and one other thing:
