					<section>
						And just like that, I destroyed another friendship.
					</section>
					<section>
						Since today is my last day of high school, I was getting worried about p03 returning this journal in time as the day neared. p03 is a binge reader, so I didn't think it would take her too long to read this; I figured she must be writing in here (I sort-of knew that p63 wouldn't write in here because she'd never be able to settle on something perfect enough, but I thought I'd be able to get p03 to write something). I was wrong. Maybe p03 had a lot of work to do, or maybe she wanted to take her time, or maybe she just slacked off in giving it back to me. As you'll see in a second, another possibility is that she wanted to hold off until she wouldn't see me again (since seniors don't have to come to school during the time of their exempted final, p03 didn't have any classes with me today). Regardless of the reason, I recieved my notebooks back yesterday at the end of the day. Later on, I texted her saying how she was killing me by not writing anything.
					</section>
					<section>
						In order to fully understand her response, I first need to tell you about the part of my journal I got rid of. I had been hoping to put all the things I'm ashamed of in one entry (following this one), but after much consideration, I decided to put the worst one (the one I wrote) here. I don't want to talk about this any more than I absolutely have to, so I'm going to say all that I plan to now. This version will be much more brief than the original one. It was longer initially because I felt the need to come completely clean <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2019/2/24">Future</span>,
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2019/2/24" data-heading="Reevaluation">
							Upon further consideration, I've come to believe that my true motivations lie in my desire for acceptance. Since I won't give myself acceptance, I felt compelled to seek it elsewhere, but I wouldn't believe that acceptance unless they knew everything. Although realizing this hasn't negated the feeling, it's helped me be more in control of it.
						</aside>
						but in retrospect, I think it was too graphic, hence getting rid of it. I feel absolutely terrible about it, and I only write it because I have to know that the people I get close to won't abandon me if they should ever find out. I hope you don't think too harshly of me.
					</section>
					<section>
						You see... the thing is... I masturbate. <span class="elaborate">It started accidentally</span> in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and has persisted despite my numerous, variably successful attempts to stop.
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							When you've been in one postition for a while or whatever, it can feel good to stretch. I discovered in 6<sup>th</sup> grade that "stretching" a certain lower part of my body produces a sensation that's not entirely unlike the favorable feeling of ordinary stretching, and I figured the origins of the feelings were the same. Over time, I found more effective ways of "stretching" in order to produce a more pronounced effect until, one day, something more happened than a pleasurable stretching feeling. It was then that I realized what was actually going on, and I was horrified. Once some of the horror had worn off, however, I thought it would be possible to produce some of the pleasurable feeling without going as far as the horrifying act. I was wrong (at least to the extent that I thought I could hold myself back). So starts my addiction.
						</aside>
						It continues because it feels good, somewhat inhibits my reasoning, doesn't really have any negative consequences, and doesn't provide me with a logical reason to stop which would <del>most certainly</del> <span class="circle">possibly</span> allow me to put an end to it (societal alienation doesn't count as a logical reason although it's definitely enough to make me feel awful about it). (I'd say the first reason and maybe the second one are the biggest, both of which are highly reminiscent of a drug addiction.) My lowest moment came when a combination of curiosity and impaired reasoning caused me to watch a pornographic video. I was so horrified by how far I'd gone that I never did it again. <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2023/2/2">Future</span> I don't want to take this weakness along with me to college, but I don't know what I'm going to do.
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/2/2" data-heading="...">... It was quite a long time.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						With this in mind, p03's responding text was as follows: "Well I didn't read all of it and I found it kind of gross and offensive and didn't really even want to talk to you. So you're lucky I didn't write something, honestly." I told her how sorry I was, and she told me it was fine, but I said how I wasn't so sure about that. She said how it didn't really affect our relationship since we weren't going to stay friends much longer because school was ending. I continued apologizing and asked if she at least read the nice things I said about her. She responded by saying, "Try not to worry about it, really, I'll move on from it I just didn't appreciate it and I considered wearing red lipstick for an entire week and also I was just a little bit annoyed that you basically just kept telling me to ask you stuff when I think that if you want to talk about something you should bring it up with someone because you're a high school senior." I didn't think I was being mean by slightly critiquing her appearance in between complimenting it, and I'm not proud of having such a hard time opening up to people. Maybe she was just put in a bad mood because of the first part, but then again, maybe not. From there she started telling me all about how she doesn't think I'm "not good enough for her," just that we're different people who don't click in that way. She also said how being friends is hard to manage occasionally (which I didn't know about or I would have put a stop to), and she told me how she just likes p012 <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span>.
						<aside>
							In any other circumstances besides this one, this would be a huge deal. Obviously, I knew p012, and he was the only other person besides p03 who I thought shared my way of thinking (although it was slightly different). Once p03 told me her thoughts on p012, it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world that they were perfect for each other, and I would have been more than happy to play matchmaker as p03 is so fond of doing. I may be the only person besides her best friend (presumably) who knows about this.
						</aside>
						p03 even said how I'm an amazing person and how I'll find someone that's perfect for me. I had always known that her not liking me more than a friend wasn't anything personal, but I was kind-of thrown off balance by the shift in conversation. After she told me how she didn't want me to be down on myself just because she had a crush on someone else, I told her how that was the last thing I was worried about at that point. She followed that up by saying how she thought everything was fine right now, but I didn't share her sentiments. She told me how she thought I messed up, but sometimes you just have to get over it; I'd be moving to a different state (Massachusetts for college), and it won't matter in a year; it'll be fine. I told her how it's not fine if I have to go to another state for things to be okay, but she insisted that I not worry. I continued worrying, and she eventually admitted that she probably won't talk to me directly because she feels extremely awkward around me now. She asked me to quit apologizing when I kept saying how sorry I was, but it didn't really work. After this went on for a little while longer, the conversation came to an end. Some time went by, and I thought I'd ask her if we'd ever text again. She said that she didn't particularly plan on it, so I wanted to say one last thing to her: "Well, I want you to know that I appreciated the friendship we had, and I'm sorry things turned out this way. I'll miss you very much." p03 ended things with a "Well thank you" ... And so concluded yet another friendship. I cried.
					</section>
					<section>
						I don't know how I can keep going on like this. Especially since my time of extreme lonliness, my relationships with others mean everything to me, and yet the most important people in my life have left me with nothing but intense emotional pain. I was just barely starting to get over losing p63, and now I have to find some way of dealing with losing p03. Do I have to be in a constant state of heart ache? If I had someone to fall back on, maybe things wouldn't be so bad because I'd have a source of support in the rough times, but I don't have anyone. I get along with an enormous amount of people, but I always keep up a barrier just in case something should go wrong. Because of this barrier, people can only get so close to me, and I find myself without anyone to turn to when hard times arrive. The only people ever allowed beyond this fortification have just reinforced the reason for its existence. How am I ever supposed to learn to let people in if I'm always punished for it?
					</section>
					<section>
						I would have thought that, after reading this journal, p03 would have developed a greater sympathy for me, but apparently I was mistaken. I may have my short-comings, and I assure you, I feel terrible about them, but do I have to be perfect to be accepted? p03 is one of the mildest, most rational people I know and is quite nice and accepting; am I really so awful that even she doesn't want anything to do with me? Is it just the one thing that turned her against me? Couldn't she tell how horrible I feel about it? Is it that it was too long? Would she react the same way now? Do I have to sacrifice another friend to find out? Is there any way of mentioning it without alienating her? What could I have done to prevent this from happening? Is there any way I can make things right? Surely she read how things between p63 and me took a turn for the worst. Doesn't she see how she's making me relive that? Doesn't she know how hard this is on me? Doesn't she even care?
					</section>
					<section>
						Today was supposed to be a day of taking in the last of my time in high school while sentimentally contemplating how much I'll miss everything and everyone. Instead, I spent the day wallowing in misery while, at one point, silently crying (not that anyone noticed). Not only do I feel bad for how things went between p03 and me but I also feel bad for not [spending more time with] and [properly missing] the friends I have left. To be honest, though, I'm probably not taking this as hard as the first time around: I've had so much practice suppressing despairing feelings, and I never really let p03 all the way in because I was scared of this exact thing happening. Furthermore, there comes a point when you don't even know how to feel any worse, and I think that point is lower ever since my culmination of self-hatred (which I still haven't talked about). However, that's not to say that I don't still feel terrible. I'm just getting exhausted from so much pain.
					</section>
					<section>
						Ironically enough, the only people who have been consistently there for me are my parents. If I didn't know I'd be harassed indefinitely after giving them any sort of insight into my life, I'd be inclined to tell them all sorts of things because at least they won't leave me.
					</section>
					<section>
						I just don't want to have to keep hoping that my own strength will pull me through. I want to have someone I can confide in and who I know will be there to support me or at least gently explain their reservations. My parents will be there for me and p03 will gently explain her reservations (I don't think I've ever been so politely told to get lost), but each of them are missing something. How much longer will I have to wait before I can have that sort of security?

						Thursday, March 29, 2018

					<section>
						As a full disclaimer, I have to say that this entry is about my addiction. Before you start worrying about the direction this will take, though, I'd like to say that I don't think it will be too bad; however, for all I know, you may disagee. Although you'll know what I decided by the time you read this, at this point in time, I'm not sure whether I'll actually include this in the regular journal or whether I'll hide it away in the special section I'll devote to talking about my addiction. Regardless, I have to say something, so that's what I'm going to do.
					</section>
					<section>
						I <strong>hate</strong> my addiction. I hate how I have no control over it; I hate how it commandeers my thought processes; I hate how it consumes my time without warning; I hate how awful it makes me feel; I hate it. You haven't seen much of how heavily it weighs on me because I'm so scared of talking about it, but I'd consider it to be just about on par with how lonely I was before I became more out-going (which is awful). Moreover, my addiction carries with it a special kind of isolation that is largely non-existent elsewhere: Although I'd be cautious about who I told what, I could discuss my lack of affection for my parents; I could tell people about my lack of religion; If I were a drug-addict, I could find people to help me through it; But with this, the most likely response to me is repulsion. The rational side of me tries to call attention to the fact that I've seen other responses and I'm statistically bound to come across someone who's accepting eventually, but I've seen so much of the opposite that it's exceptionally difficult for me to take comfort in that. In particular (as I'm sure you're thinking), the events that transpired between p03 and me significantly decreased my hope that there are people out there who will stick around after they find out (even if, at the time, the topic was addressed in an excessively explicit manner). p03 is the nicest, most accepting person I know/knew, and if she doesn't want anything to do with me, how can anyone else?

						Tuesday was an especially hard time for me. (This is seriously the earliest I could talk about it, despite a high degree of determination.) As happens fairly regularly, I had to wear one of the large number of my pants that were a little too tight for me. <span class="elaborate obvious">Elaboration</span>
						<aside>
							They aren't tight enough to justify to my parents that they should be gotten rid of (or maybe I'm just being pessimistic), but they present quite an annoyance. Luckily, I got some new pants this past summer or else even more of them would be a little too tight.
						</aside>
						If I were a girl, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the construction of my body, I'm predisposed to encountering issues. In particular, random (or non-random) fluctuations in my hormone levels are capable of producing an obstruction to comfortable sitting. With tighter pants, it's possible for that uncomfortableness to border on painfulness as happened on Tuesday. (This doesn't happen very often or else I would demand new pants from my parents.) Naturally, my corrupted mind saw this as an opportunity to entertain my addiction, but I'm not one to willingly torture myself, so I took measures to prevent it. Of those measures, the most effective one was a persuasive essay I had begun writing in an effort to call attention to my motivations for discontinuing this activity when I'm not thinking clearly. Even though it isn't finished, as has happened every other time I read it, my urges were replaced with intense disappointment for what my life had become. However, I still couldn't sit. In order to adequately rectify the situation, I had to go to the bathroom, but I ended up spending the majority of my time there crying. (I bet you were starting to think I did something else.) Luckily, the place was pretty deserted, so I didn't have to worry about anyone hearing me. I usually try to occupy my mind with more manageable thoughts, but this time, the full force of what a disgusting undisciplined disappointment I am really set in. For a good 20 minutes, I stood around in there thoroughly sobbing, banging my head against the side of the stall, and despairing over my future (and past and present). Eventually, though, I collected myself and attempted to be productive.
					</section>
					<section>
						Reading this, you may think that I should have been happy that I scored a victory, but the thing you overlook is that I've scored plenty of victories in the past, and yet the problem remains. I'd like to think that the persuasive essay I wrote will continue to keep my addiction at bay, but I have no way of being sure of that. I'm just so tired of being miserable; I want it to stop. If I could take some magical pill to put an end to my addiction, I'd do it in a heartbeat. More drastic than that, I've given some serious thought to, at some point in the future after having kids, effectively having myself neutered. I just hate this so much. It's been some time now since I decided that I may not be able to resolve this on my own, but who can I tell? My parents who will exacerbate the situation? My friends who will leave me? One of the many organizations established to help with such an addiction? Society has made it very clear that this isn't something that's okay to talk about, and I definitely feel the pressure to conform. The Internet, however, seems to have a completely different point-of-view. When you look up how to stop an addiction such as mine, you get two kinds of results: ones that tell you you don't need to stop, and ones that tell you you should just trust in God. As you might imagine, I don't find either of those results very helpful. Those results, though, suggest an entirely different distribution of opinions than I'm familiar with, and I'm skeptical of their accuracy. Even if 5% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad, I still want to stop for that other 95%; even if 25% of the population doesn't think my addiction is bad and another 50% can accept me, there's still that other 25% and that 50% surely wouldn't think of me as being as virtuous as they thought before; even if 100% of the population suddenly decided that my addiction is rather insignificant, it would still be quite some time before I could move past the disgust that has been so thoroughly instilled in me. I can't give definite numbers to who will think what, but I don't think I have the greatest odds, especially among the people I get to know. <span class="elaborate obvious">Explanation</span>
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							Although I'm not saying other people are inferior or that I only associate with certain people, I do have a tendency to form stronger bonds with the type of people who are generally thought of as meeting higher academic and moral standards, but it's because they meet those standards that I'm worried that I'll no longer seem like the person they want to be around.
						</aside>
						As I contemplate giving this journal to my closest friends once it's finished, I'm worried about what will happen if this is still an issue: People may be able to look past something that affected me <em>in the past</em>, but what will they think if it's still going on? I'd like to have the previously written part of my journal digitized by the end of the summer and have the events since then caught up by winter break. That only gives me a limited window to resolve this, especially if I would need at least a month or so free from this to have any sort of certainty that it's gone. (I've gone about a year free from it before, so a month is an absolute minimum.) I just want this to be over. I'm so tired of feeling awful. I want my life back.

						There's a 0% chance that I'm going to finish this today, but I've been putting off starting this for far too long, and if I wait for a convenient time, my emotions will subside, and I'll want to spend my time doing other things; that's already starting to be true.<span class="elaborate">*</span>

					<section>
						It always starts after I've been eased into a sense of security. I've gone a long time without succumbing; I haven't really been thinking about any of this much at all; As a matter of fact, investing all of that energy into such an activity seems like a rather taxing experience: it's not worth it. Then, like a hawk swooping in for the kill, the activity suddenly doesn't seem so taxing anymore. Maybe it was caused by the lyrics of a song; maybe it was caused by suspicious activities happening in a neighboring room; maybe it was just the result of a random fluctuation of hormones. Sometimes, it's not even anything that has an immediately noticeable effect. Regardless, the seed has been sown. I begin to become curious about what I would have considered dull not too long ago. I think about all kinds of things all the time; maybe I could let my mind wander a little bit this time as well... BUT WAIT! I've been through this before! I know where this is going. I've put so much time and energy into overcoming this addiction, and I'm on a streak right now. I've been making myself miserable over this for years; it's about time that I did myself a service and put an end to this... But I'm not thinking about anything all that bad right now. I know I don't want to get carried away, but a little fantasizing never hurt anyone... But wait. I've been through this before. My addiction tries to mask itself as innocent idle considerations, but I know the truth: it's a slippery slope leading into a pit of dispair. I can't do this to myself... But I'm actually kind-of interested in what I'm thinking about; it's a rather stimulating course of thought. I think I'll be okay... <span style="font-size:.75rem">But wait. I've been through this before. I know where I'm headed, and I'm lying to myself to get there</span>... I don't know why I don't get caught up in this more often: it's pretty fun to play out this scenario in my head... <span style="font-size:.5rem">But wait. I've been through this before</span>... Huh.

						Last night, I had a dream about p09. In between a bunch of other random science-related stuff, we had friendly conversation and worked together on a variety of things. At one point, p09 semi-abruptly walked out of a building I was in, and I followed her. When I caught up with her, she looked torn, and she told me how she had found the link to this journal and read it (implying that she read about my addiction even though, in the real world, there's not much to read about at this point in time). I was extremely worried about what would happen next, but I tried to not freak out, and I let her have her space as I went back to doing whatever I was doing (at that time, I think it was organizing an event). Later on, I saw p09 come back to do her share of some of the work, but I couldn't tell what she thought of me since she was busy and kind-of far away. Eventually, however, p09 came over to me and, although seemingly still trying to process what she had found out, she told me how she hadn't left me. Since I hadn't yet recovered from my panic attack, I didn't say much, but I thought how, after I calmed down some, I'd very much like to give her a hug... I just hope the real world isn't too different.

						I don't know how I can keep going on like this. No matter what I do, the same thing keeps happening over and over again. I like to think that I'm at least on the path towards some kind of resolution, but I've been trying to convince myself of that for years, and I haven't seen any results. I was thinking about how long this has been going on, and I was shocked when I finally put a number to it: about 9 years. This has been a constant struggle for nearly half of my life. If you only count what I remember, I have more memories of my life with this problem than I do without it. When you've been dealing with the same problem for 9 years, you begin to wonder if there will ever be a solution. I've tried so many things to get me to stop, but it's never good enough. For a long time I thought that, if I could just think of a logical reason to stop (based on evidence, not what people happen to believe), I would be able to end this. When I lost p03, I thought I had come up with a reason: This plainly had me addicted, and addictions are bad. Afterall, anyone who experiences a loss like that and then goes back to participating in the thing that drove them away must have a problem. However, my addiction wouldn't give up so easily: Soon enough, I was thinking about how other things exhibited addictive qualities such as eating and spending time with people. (The desire for them increases the longer you go without them, and you feel good when you give in.) This led me to a futile attempt to determine what's okay to be addicted to and what the meaning of life is. Before I knew it, I was back at square one. Time went by, and maybe about a year ago, I thought I figured it out again: It didn't matter whether my addiction should be condemned or not; the fact remains that it is, and I'll never be happy while this is holding me hostage. Not only did this provide a solid line of reasoning (which I should have thought of long ago), but it also conveniently circumvented my difficulties reconciling my addiction and its shared variety. (If the only thing that mattered was what people thought, it didn't really matter if I considered the two activities to be essentially the same.) It was at this point that I had to face the reality that my belief that logic would allow me to direct my actions was really just a hopeful fantasy serving to hinder my identification of the true issue. More recently (maybe before winter break), I found myself miserable and sleep-deprived once again when I should have been doing homework or sleeping, and it occurred to me that I have absolutely no control over my addiction, and it's destroying my life. This isn't a particularly new thought, but that time, it really sunk in that my addiction is calling <em>all</em> the shots, and it's <em>completely</em> destroying my life. Moreover, I finally accepted that I'm completely incapable of making a sound decision when my addiction is trying to assert itself. Accompanying that was the evaluation that <em>both</em> varieties of my addiction would produce the same results and so both should be avoided. Realizing that this could cause problems in marriage, I conceded that such activities could be planned for specific times which would minimize the destructive influence; however, stopping altogether would make things easier since, the longer I resist my addiction, the easier it is to do so. This line of reasoning has the added benefits of reconciling my addiction with its shared variety and reinforcing the need to rely on automatic forms of resistance instead of evaluating things on the fly. As you surely guessed, though, this still didn't prove to be infallible.

						There were going to be a lot of things for me to say, but I seriously can't afford to invest any more time in this. (Depending on where this is when you read it, it may be worth noting that this used to be in the section of the website devoted to my addiction.) I was hoping to at least say some things about p024, but I'll miss class if I do that, and I have many other academic obligations that would make it irresponsible for me to continue working on this later. (By the way, the class I would be missing is on the 26<sup>th</sup>; I've been working on this through the night.) I'll just say that I really, really hope this works out, and if it does, p024 will find herself with a friend she'll never be able to get rid of.

						I hate my addiction so much. I hate how I can't manage convince myself that it's a bad idea both practically and emotionally despite the fact that I come to that conclusion essentially every time afterwards. I hate ruining good days with it and worsening tense days. I hate feeling so ashamed so often. I hate my addiction so much.

						If I were to go with my typical policy of dating entries, this would still be May 1<sup>st</sup> (since it's the early-morning hours), but I wanted to keep these thoughts separate from the previous ones. Naturally, I don't have time for this, but... there is no rationalization. My life is so messed up.
					</section>
					<section>
						As much as I try to supress it, there are times when I can't escape my innate desire to share my addiction with someone; and I don't mean with words. The primary reason life persists is because it reproduces, so it only makes sense for living things to be designed with such aspirations built-in. Being a living thing, that naturally applies to me, but being an intelligent living thing, I try to have my life mean more than that, and being a social living thing, I'm subject to societal pressures. It's blatantly obvious that those last two points have brought me into significant conflict with the urges resulting from the first one.
					</section>
					<section>
						Man, I don't have time for this! I have a large amount of important homework due, and yet I find myself typing here.
					</section>
					<section>
						Anyway, the point I'm trying to get at is that I generally place my addiction into it's own category, separate from the reproductive activities which it's surely trying to promote, but increasingly (though still infrequently), I've found myself thinking beyond the basic pleasure response to the idea that I'd very much like to partake in a shared addiction. I know I'm by no means the only one to feel that way, and as a matter of fact, at this stage in people's lives, there's only an extremely small percentage of people who can say that they haven't done the actual act (by my estimate, there's perhaps around 10 or less people who fall into that category, and that's among everyone I know), but discomfort about the topic has been too firmly entrenched into my mind, and I can't help but feel like succombing to the idea of wanting to have a physically intimate relationship with someone else would be reaching a new low. Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said the desire didn't exist.

						<span class="elaborate obvious">Completely unrelated side-note.</span>
						<aside class="t3" data-heading="Random interruption">
							Since I'll forget if I don't mention it right this second, I'll admit that, on Friday (almost a week ago) when I got a new phone (which I definitely should have made an entry on without relying on my gap-filling recollection to address it), I lied for a fourth time. When transferring my phone service over, a customer-service representative called to make sure that everything was working properly. They had asked me whether I had tested making a call, and I told them "yes" even though I had only tested texting by that time. I tested calling soon afterwards <span class="revised" data-reason="request" data-date="2023/2/27">[removed content]</span>, but I can't cut that event out of my life and place it further back in time. I know this is a rather trivial incident, but I take my adherence to truth very seriously, and I don't like anything which compromises that. I'm wondering, however, whether I should continue mentioning such inconsequential slip-ups. I don't want to hide anything from anyone, but everything else in my life has to reach a certain level of importance before it's worthy of being mentioned; why shouldn't that apply to this as well? I suppose only time will tell.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						Something I'm worried about, though, is the potential of having fantasies with people I know. Up to this point, I've prevented myself from thinking such things because of how much I've reviled the idea, but depending on the circumstances, playful moments I have with girls can later tempt me to imagine being playful with them in a different environment. I've compromised so many other principles in pursuit of my addiction; is it just a matter of time until I compromise this one? Another thought I've been resisting is that my desire for a girlfriend is actually just a manifestation of my desire to more effectively satisfy my addiction. I have no doubt that the same hormones are responsible for both feelings, but I haven't yet given up on the idea that my desire for a girlfriend is significantly influenced by a more general desire for close companionship. Regardless, I do a fairly thorough job of separating my emotional needs from my instinctual drives, so I generally don't think of them together. But my instinctual drives continue to attempt to assert themselves, and I worry that my friends will unwittingly find themselves much more involved than they want to be. This has become particularly relevant with getting to know p024. As you know, the events that transpired between us brought us very close to each other, and although I still wouldn't say that I'm convinced it would be a good idea for us to go out (especially since it increasingly seems like she isn't interested), I sincerely love her. When that's combined how freely she's willing to share her body with guys, the less innocent parts of me begin to see potential. I really don't want to say so, but largely because of my aversion to mentioning it, I have to admit that there have been a few times when I thought it would be rather nice to pursue a much higher level of intimacy with p024. Naturally, I don't have any intention of taking advantage of her like that, and the few times I've thought that are pretty much exclusively in the past, but I feel like it's inevitable that such thoughts will return in relation to someone at some point. That being said, it's actually very likely that, if I have the right relationship with the person, they'll <em>want</em> me to think that about them. This brings up another issue: how would I handle a situation like that? Although I somehow manage to feel pressured to refrain from going all the way with a girl until marriage, among my generation at this point in time, it's essentially unquestioned that going out with someone will progress to that point within a relatively short period of time. However, I've considered an insistance of that before marriage to be one of my only deal-breakers. But then the question arises: if I would want the same thing as this hypothetical girl and I'd likely marry them eventually anyway by that point, why should I call things off after such a (hardline) request? Although I don't mean to insult her, p024's lifestyle has gone a long way towards helping me establish the notion that I don't have to be so perfect all the time. Don't get me wrong: thinking that I don't have to be so perfect all the time is a good thing to inspire, but that also extends to things like this situation. Aiding that is my recent attainment of drinking age: I may choose to say this earlier, but after I had realized that I had successfully never drank underage, I was overcome by this sickeningly hollow feeling. Despite having stayed true to what I've always aspired to do (including not drinking on my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday), I couldn't help but feel like all it proved was that I was a stickler for the rules and that people should continue expecting me to be the ideal person. Especially if I have to make an effort to avoid it, I think there's a very legitimate possibility that the victory of waiting until marriage will seem just as hollow. I don't know if I can compromise on that, though: I've tried imagining what it would be like (and I'm typically very good at predicting my behavior), and I can only honestly see myself becoming overwhelmed with guilt (but becoming thoroughly addicted if I followed through). Luckily, I don't have to face this problem right now, but if and when my wish for a girlfriend is granted, I'm not sure how things are going to play out.
					</section>

						Since I seemed to have gotten through all of this without ever specifying my motivation for typing it in the first place, I'll say that my addiction is relentless, and my increasing desire to involve someone else makes it all the worse. My dad has told me a number of times (when I was younger) that, soon enough, physically intimate activities would be all I could think about; although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's <em>all</em> I think about, it has definitely become a prevalent force in my life. (It doesn't help that I'm constantly surrounded by it, either.) Moreover, my addiction is completely indifferent to my emotions, and it will attempt to reassert itself even if I had been wallowing in despair over it literally just hours (or less) before.

						Although this is surely old news to you, my addiction is messing up my life. As I may have said before and as is the case for most things, my addictive tendencies come in waves, and I'm in a big one right now. I've been demonstrating considerably less control over my behavior, and it's proving to be a big issue considering how the year is coming to a close (and a lot of stuff is becoming due). Take today for instance: Because I lack even a basic desire to control myself, I was left with mere minutes to submit an assignment online for my Chemistry lab (which I'm in jeopardy of failing). Luckily, it was a pretty easy assignment, and I was able to throw something halfway decent together seconds before the deadline passed. At the same time, though, because it was such an easy assignment, it's extremely frustrating that it came down to this. Worse than that, I have a take-home final which I haven't even started due in a matter of hours, and I'm not even planning on getting to work on it immediately (because I'm typing in here and I still need to take a shower since I fell asleep at my computer again last night). But the fun doesn't end there: Although I woke up early enough to both take a shower and get breakfast, I did neither because of my addiction (and something else must have happened too). Moreover, p018 invited me to eat lunch with her and p034, but because of the things going on, I don't think I have time to do so. Even more over, I was going to go to Subway for lunch today to splurge and pay for everyone else's meals with my left-over flex dollars, but now I don't have time for that, and the more I put it off, the less likely there will be stuff left to splurge on and the less likely people will want to conserve their meals and accept my payment. And this is just one example of how my life is crumbling around me. I really don't want to admit to it, but when p024 visited on Saturday (depending on how I order the entries in the end, you may find this event surprising), despite how I <em>really</em> wanted to greet her as she entered the Towers complex, I ended up needing to catch up with her later because of a preoccupation with my addiction. My life is so messed up.
					</section>
					<section>
						But I want to share my addiction with a girl so badly. This is actually the second time that I've considered mentioning this (more than an occasional reference), but I decided against it last time because I didn't want to risk becoming too obscene and regretting it when I'm thinking more clearly later. Really, none of that reasoning has changed, but somehow, feeling the need to say something about it for the second time seems to justify its mention. I don't think I can get into much detail because, even though this entry is currently in a section of its own, I'm still terrified of losing all of my friends. However, I can say that, at this particular moment, my desire to partake in reproductive activities is exceptionally intense. It doesn't help that I continue finding more effective ways of entertaining that desire. I may still be using rather formal language to address my feelings on this subject, but if you were to listen in on my mind, you'd quickly discover that my thoughts are anything but formal. I'd very much like to get to know a girl on an extremely intimate level. Imagine my rant about how much I want a girlfriend applying to this. I'm sure you're thinking, though, that it really did apply to this; I maintain, however, that despite an essentially identical biochemical motivation, my mind generally groups those two things separately. I'd be lying, though, if I told you that didn't recognize the potential of a girlfriend providing more than just companionship. However, that goes back to my last entry on this topic: Could I really take things all the way with my girlfriend before marriage and not feel guilty about it afterwards? Although I'm surely not in a state of mind to provide reliable insight on the answer right now, I'm currently inclined to say "yes". I continually become more desensitized in this area, so could it be that I'm slowly moving in the direction of actually believing that or is it just that I can't accurately forsee the consequences at this time? (Coming back to fill in an answer at a later time could resolve this nicely for you, but it's not worth it; you can wonder just like I am right now.) <span class="reflection" data-date="2023/2/3">(Although it's rarely worth planning on coming back to fill something in, I occasionally reread things, so I could provide you with a reasonably confident answer at this time, but I'm not going to. You can wonder just like I was at the time.)</span> The very fact that I currently might believe that I'd be okay with getting physical with my girlfriend, though, introduces a serious problem: What if I can convince myself of that when the opportunity arises, but it turns out not to be true? In the event that such an opportunity arose, there would be many chances for me to change my mind, and it's not uncommon that I convince myself that I'm braver than I actually am, so there's still a very good chance that I would back out of it, but as I try to consider what I would do if I had a girlfriend who was prompting me to satisfy her desires as well as mine... I don't know... Maybe I wouldn't do it. But I'd want to so badly. I don't know. I'm almost wanting to convince myself that I'd follow through because I want it so badly, and there's no better way of placating myself than to get intimate with a girl, especially one that I loved. One thing I can say for sure, though, is that if I did it once, it would unquestionably become a regular occurence: One of the main things holding me back is the idea that I'm on a long streak, and I shouldn't break it; if I indulged even once, though, my thought process would be, "Well, I already lost the 'glory' of waiting until marriage, what difference does it make what I do now?" That makes it especially imperative that I not make the wrong decision. However, depending on the circumstances, it could get very difficult to determine what the right decision would be. For example: Say I had a gorgeous long-time girlfriend who was more loving than anyone else I knew. Maybe one day she decides that she wants to take things to the next level with me, but I decline. She's polite about it and tries to wait until I'm ready, but soon enough she's saying that she needs to be able to make love with her boyfriend for her to feel completely connected to him, and if I can't offer that, she thinks she might have to move on. Given that I'd actually be more than happy to resolve that for her and that I'd surely love her deeply and be very upset if she left, I legitimately don't know what I'd do. If she was inconsiderate about it, I'd probably stick with my principles and tell myself that I should wait for a girlfriend that cares more about my feelings; if she was nice about it, though, and we were really that close... I don't know; I'd have a really hard time countering the argument that it doesn't matter if we're surely going to get married anyway. It's entirely possible that I would give in. But is that wrong? I suspect that there's hardly a person alive (especially anywhere near my age) who would have a problem with a serious couple getting intimate with each other. Moreover, that's typically the <em>expectation</em>. In my quest for perfection, I end up acquiring traditional aversions which may no longer have a place in the definition of perfection. Although my general opinion of my addiction is that I hate it, when I'm in the midst of it, I don't dislike it any more than I would trying to program a super awesome game. More than that, I actually want to become more thoroughly engrossed in it. It's not until the feeling subsides that it really hits me that I just wasted hours on my addiction when I should have been doing something such as finishing my final. I really want to share my addiction so badly, though... Man, I want to be that close to a girl; I want to make a girl feel that good; I want to experience that kind of absolute bliss; I just want it so much.

						As I've mentioned before, it's not uncommon for me to wonder about just how much I can say about topics related to my addiction. As you've surely noticed, addressing these things concerns me so much that I do everything I can to avoid even saying the words which stand for these ideas. Not only do I worry about losing my perceived sense of dignified maturity but I also have the very real fear of disgusting people by providing too many details. I don't need to remind you about what happened with p03, but even if that hadn't happened, I've acquired certain expectations of people's reactions, and it's very easy for me to see people getting overwhelmed by hidden animalistic side; that's not to mention the fact that I have my own extremely hypocritical (though supressed) disgust of people partaking in similar activities. Thinking back to my high school days, I can remember how p035, p036, and their friends <span class="elaborate obvious reflection" data-date="2023/2/3">reconsideration</span>
						<aside class="reflection" data-date="2023/2/3" data-heading="Reconsideration">
							I'm wondering if I meant p037 instead of p036 because she was the one who most frequently associated with p035, and it's that group of people which I most strongly associate with shamelessly discussing explicit topics, but I don't think p036 was bashful either, and I may have been trying to reference two separate groups of people.
						</aside>
						would shamelessly discuss an endless variety of explicit topics, and they would never be subjected to sideways glances or people avoiding them (relatively speaking), so you may be led to believe that my fears are unfounded; however, besides that fact that they're girls and are therefore subject to a different set of expectaions, I know that not everyone is like them, and even if they were, I still couldn't be sure about topics not discussed even by them (such as an addiction like my own). From a purely probablistic standpoint, there must be people who don't care about any of this (and having p024 stand by me really helps diminish the pessimism I have about that), but I can't get over the feeling that there will come a point when people can't stand it anymore. I like to think that dispersing these entries throughout my journal and being cautious about my word choice helps keep things below that threshold, but still the feeling persists. An important principle of this journal is to not hold back on any aspect of my life, and I stay true to that in all other things, but when it comes to anything even remotely involving my reproductive system, it's hard for me to say whether I'm still doing that ideal justice. For the record, I'm definitely addressing the most essential parts (I could never be at peace otherwise), but when it comes to things that only moderately affect my life, it's rather common that I feel that I need to keep it to myself. I know you've seen me talk about some very frivolous stuff, so you would think that something that moderately affects my life would definitely make the cut, but I have significantly higher standards when it comes to areas such as these. These standards aren't for myself, though; they're for others: I legitimately think that people don't want to hear about stuff like that. In a diary not meant for other people, I may dig into these things thoroughly, but I need to keep my audience in mind while composing this. At the same time, though, I know there's no way that I'm the only one experiencing these things, and part of me says that I should use this as an opportunity to show other people that they're not alone and maybe help provide them with some direction, but the fear... I'm not sure if there's any way of getting over this besides a <em>lot</em> of people reading this and giving positive, or at least neutral, feedback. I likely would have used this time to express my frustration about how certain extremely common changes in bloodflow result in a near-impossibility of comfortable sitting, but I'm inclined to believe that anything beyond that brief summary would be inappropriate for me to discuss. Instead, I thought I'd describe the internal struggle I have every time I contemplate expanding on this subject... Well, that and one other thing:

						I really don't want to say anything about my addiction, but looking at this section devoted to it and seeing how it's going on 4 years (July 9, 2019) since I offered any thoughts on the matter (here), I feel like I should give some kind of update on my situation. The majority of the particularly important developments I'm going to recount in separate entries (which have a good chance of showing up here in the future) which I'll arrange in an order that would be sequential to the typical reader, and I already said a little bit in the entry I wrote about my breakup with p025, so this is going to be more of a general overview (which likely wouldn't need to be hidden away in the Addiction section of this website but which seems to fit here best at this time).
					</section>
					<section class="t8">
						The summary is that I'm still a victim of my addiction, but my mind has been on other things, and it hasn't felt as debilitating as it has in the past. Although it's not a new realization, I still think it's crazy how, the more I resist my addiction, the harder it fights back, but when I'm too exhausted to do anything about it, it has a much smaller (though still existent) influence on my life. I've tried to leverage that knowledge to calmly discontinue my addiction by just not letting myself place any importance on it, but that hasn't been any more successful than the vast array of other tactics I've employed. When you've spent 13 years in the clutches of an addiction, it can be hard to not just admit defeat. Then again, I've had the code from p13 for almost 11 years, and I'm still determined to solve it. Then again again, I've worked on my addiction more, and when I work on the code, I generally make some kind of progress as opposed my addiction where I just keep going in circles. Speaking of codes (but unrelated to this), I still have the code p022 wrote me; I wonder what it says (and how much I'll cry upon reading it). Anyway, after breaking up with p025, I'm still transitioning into what my life is now, and I'm still experiencing a fair bit of emotional fatigue, so my addiction hasn't been something I've been beating myself up about lately. While I was with p025, I wasn't sure what I felt about my addiction (or our shared addiction), but it didn't seem as worthy of rebuke, so it's been a while since I've been sickened by myself like I was in past entries. On a side note, I do too good of a job at describing my emotions: When I read my past entries on my addiction (and in general), it feels like it all happened just last week, and I feel the pain just like I would have then. It's awful. <span class="elaborate obvious">Another side note</span>
						<aside data-heading="Side note">
							Related to reading past entries on my addiction, something not as depressing was when I reread the entry for <span data-revisit="link">May 7, 2019</span>, and I had the opportunity to answer a question in there, but then I deliberately didn't answer it and made it known that I didn't answer it. I rather enjoyed that.
						</aside>
						Coming back to the present, though, I could debate how I think past events will affect my future, particularly once my emotional fatigue has subsided, but I'm having a really hard time predicting what will come of all of this. I'm not particularly optimistic about overcoming my addiction, but with how much my life has changed and with how much I anticipate it changing in the relatively near future, I can hardly hazard a guess at how I'll feel about it. Maybe I'll really surprise myself and, after establishing a new (and hopefully improved) life for myself, I'll be so happy that I won't have room in my heart to look down upon people with an addiction like mine and yet, at the same time, I'll inadvertently overcome my own addiction simply because I'm much less likely to partake in it when I'm happy. Who knows?
					</section>
					<section class="revised" data-reason="request" data-date="2023/2/27">
						Maybe this was a bad time to write an update because I don't know what's going on with me right now. I wanted to write something, though, because I'm going to have p019 read my entry about breaking up with p025, and I definitely don't want to explain to her in real time what my addiction is, so I'm going to send her here. I was waiting on telling her about my addiction until she could read my journal in-full, but although I seem to be in a period of elevated journal productivity, it'll still be quite some time before I have everything up-to-date (assuming my elevated productivity lasts that long), and if I want to strengthen my bonds with my friends, I can't keep barriers between them. I'm not too worried about losing her, but I don't want to make any assumptions. It also helps a great deal that I have people to fall back on if she decides to discontinue her friendship with me. I say this primarily for her reference, but she'll be the sixth person to find this out about me, and if she decides to stick around, she'll increase the number of friends I have who know by 50%. (The other two are p018 and <span class="elaborate">obviously</span> p024.)
						<aside data-heading="Elaboration">
							I say "obviously" because, in order for her to get to this point in my addiction entries, she has to first read about how I told p024 and she didn't leave me.
						</aside>
						I was originally planning on showing more people my journal entry on the breakup as a way of telling them what I've been going through and strengthening our bonds, but when it occurred to me just how much private information I casually reference (like my addiction), I decided to restrict the number of people who would see it. My addiction isn't the only thing p019 doesn't know about me from that entry, and some other things might be hard for me to talk about, but this is the one thing I haven't been willing to tell her in the past, and it's about time that I made room for her among my closest friends.
					</section>
					<section class="revised" data-reason="request" data-date="2023/2/27">
						I could've ended the entry right there, and I think that would've been a pretty good closing, but I wanted to mention how I remember having a discussion with p019 years ago about how there was at least one thing (this) that I wasn't comfortable talking about with her at the time. I'm pretty sure it came up in the context of her saying how she was going to quiz me to death and find out everything there is to know about me (which I wasn't particularly against except for this one thing and maybe a few others). During this conversation, I'm pretty sure she told me how there were things she wouldn't tell me. <span class="elaborate obvious">Coincidence</span>
						<aside data-heading="Coincidence">
							In a rather interesting twist of fate, just today, p019 mentioned how something made her sad, but she didn't want to tell me any details.
						</aside>
						Well, I'm not going to coerce information out of anybody, so if there's something she's not comfortable telling me, it'll just have to remain a mystery, but with the conclusion of this entry, she knows most of the important things about me, and there's literally nothing I'll be unwilling to tell her about myself. The ball's in your court now.

						I need to learn to regulate my feelings better. Coming out of my relationship with p025, I still haven't returned to the way I was before being in a relationship, but I can feel myself moving in that direction (although I'll probably be somewhat different in the end). The most relevant example of this progression is how there's <span class="p0">a teaching assistant</span> in the How To Grow (Almost) Anything class who I think is rather cute, both in her appearance and in her voice. As I've noticed basically every time I came back from a break in college (especially summer break), the sudden increase in my exposure to similarly-aged attractive girls puts a strain on my composure because I'm out of practice at handling the allure (although the allure is decreased when I'm in a relationship). I think it would be reaching to say that I ever truly had a handle on things, especially when I was dying to have a girlfriend, but it would become easier to maintain my composure as time went by and I grew more accustomed to the types of people in my environment. Having been traveling and interacting with very few people for so long, I'm having an especially hard time keeping myself in check now that I'm taking a class administered by a college with college-age people in attendance (<span class="elaborate">more or less</span>).
						<aside data-heading="Explanation">
							The people attending the class in-person are MIT and Harvard students who are necessarily college-age, but the people attending the class virtually can be any age, and I'd say they tend to be closer to middle-aged.
						</aside>
						There are other pretty girls there (although I can't see all of them), but that one particular teaching assistant caught my eye, especially since her position would make it so that I'd see her frequently. If I weren't tired and mildly numb right now, the stuff I've said would surely make me cringe, but whether or not I like indulging or drawing attention to those thoughts doesn't change the fact that they exist. Much to my relief, I seem to be able to prevent myself from having explicit thoughts about anyone I know, but I still don't like objectifying people, and the mere existence of attraction towards someone marks them in my mind as someone I need to exercise more restraint towards. Normally, that restraint is primarily geared towards preventing myself from giving them preferrential treatment or from developing unwarranted affection towards them, and that was largely the case yesterday at the first offical class when I saw the teaching assistant and began wrestling with the anger I so commonly feel towards myself when I'm attracted to someone and consequentially have to make an extra effort to not be ridiculous. However, this time, for whatever reason, I felt like it was especially important to make sure that I didn't experience any explicit thoughts of her. As I anticipated seeing her again today, I worried about what I might have to fight against in my mind, and I made a substantial effort to police my thoughts and do whatever else I needed to do in order to prepare for the possibility of seeing her again today. (Since it's so early in the course, I'm not yet sure who runs what.) When the class started today, I did indeed see that teaching assistant again, and the moment I saw her, I was overcome by a feeling of profound guilt regarding what I feared thinking about her. Suddenly, all of that preparation I did seemed not only unneccesary but also indicative of a corrupted mind. Only a corrupted mind would need to expend so much energy preventing something that shouldn't happen in the first place. I'd like to think that my over-preparation and difficulty navigating my existing feelings are problems that will fade as my exposure continues, and there's a pretty good chance of that, but the expectation that things will improve is based on past experience, not on my ability to foresee how my feelings will progress over time. <span class="elaborate obvious">Clarification</span>

							Usually when I'm experiencing any variety of emotions, I have a respectable ability to predict which feelings will last and which will fade, even if I haven't had that experience before. In this particular situation (and similar ones), maybe it's because I feel so guilty about it and it brings out my pessimism, but it feels like I'll never be able to escape these emotions. That would conflict with my past experiences, however.

						Unrelated to anything else I said here, I was thinking about it, and if things had progressed the same way they did after parting ways with p022, I'd be a few weeks into a new relationship by now. If you counted from when we decided to not stay together after p022 went to pharmacy school, you could add another month to the time, so maybe my new relationship would start a few weeks from now. I definitely do not feel ready for a new relationship, and although I thought it all along, it especially seems crazy now how quickly I went from p022 to p025. It definitely helped that there weren't any hard feelings between p022 and me, but that's still quite a short period of time for me. It makes me think again about how I would feel if p022 was the one who quickly found a new boyfriend while I watched from the sidelines; I don't know how the dust would've settled in that whirlwind of emotions, and I surely would've tried to portray positivity, but I don't think I would've taken it as well as p022 (assuming she wasn't faking her positivity).

						Unrelated to any of this again, I need to work out a better way of determining how much time I should be spending on my journal. I want to keep making progress and make sure to add important moments as they come up, but there's only so much time in the day, and even though my journal is no longer my number one priority, I've still been spending much more time working on it than I should. Particularly after my car breaking down and needing a moderately expensive repair a week ago, I need to be building up my money to make sure I'm prepared for any future problems, but I haven't been working at all. I haven't even replaced the (fairly small amount of) money I used up just by living while spending the past month writing about my breakup with p025. That's not even to mention how I'm still wanting to go to Boston and nearby areas. I'm okay with giving myself a personal day from time to time or even for a while if there's reason, but I've already had a personal month, and now I need to start getting my act together. We'll see how that goes. On a side note, I think it's ridiculous how doctors don't see the point in attempting to prescribe any medication for ADD if you're not in school or working because I have no problem identifying difficulties in my life resulting from me wasting huge amounts of time on everything even when I'm not in school or working.
