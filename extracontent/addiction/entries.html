					There's a 0% chance that I'm going to finish this today, but I've been putting off starting this for far too long, and if I wait for a convenient time, my emotions will subside, and I'll want to spend my time doing other things; that's already starting to be true.<note-><div><div>But I have reason to believe that it won't happen.</div></div></note-> I think the easiest way to cover everything is to just start at the beginning of the process and describe my thoughts along the way, all while trying to keep repulsive details to a minimum.

					It always starts after I've been eased into a sense of security. I've gone along time without succumbing; I haven't really been thinking about any of this much at all; As a matter of fact, investing all of that energy into such an activity seems like a rather taxing experience: it's not worth it. Then, like a hawk swooping in for the kill, the activity suddenly doesn't seem so taxing anymore. Maybe it was caused by the lyrics of a song; maybe it was caused by suspicious activities happening in a neighboring room; maybe it was just the result of a random fluctuation of hormones. Sometimes, it's not even anything that has an immediately noticeable effect. Regardless, the seed has been sown. I begin to become curious about what I would have considered dull not too long ago. I think about all kinds of things all the time; maybe I could let my mind wander a little bit this time as well... BUT WAIT! I've been through this before. I know where this is going. I've put so much time and energy into overcoming this addiction, and I'm on a streak right now. I've been making myself miserable over this for years; it's about time that I did myself a service and put an end to this... But I'm not thinking about anything all that bad right now. I know I don't want to get carried away, but a little fantasizing never hurt anyone... But wait. I've been through this before. My addiction tries to mask itself as innocent idle considerations, but I know the truth: it's a slippery slope leading into a pit of dispair. I can't do this to myself... But I'm actually kind-of interested in what I'm thinking about; it's a rather stimulating course of thought. I think I'll be okay... <span style="font-size:.75rem">But wait. I've been through this before. I know where I'm headed, and I'm lying to myself to get there</span>... I don't know why I don't get caught up in this more often: it's pretty fun to play out this scenario in my head... <span style="font-size:.5rem">But wait. I've been through this before</span>... Huh. I've never considered that exact aspect before... <span style="font-size:.25rem">But wait</span>..................

					And then I'm no longer in control. It doesn't matter what other people would think; It doesn't matter how much homework I have; it doesn't matter what time of night it is; it doesn't even matter if I was literally just starting to get over the guilt of a previous failure. There's only one thing that I care about, and it's not even myself.
