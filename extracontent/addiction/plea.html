				This is something I wrote to myself in an effort to help me see reason when my addiction is trying to assert itself. It's not totally finished, but it makes a lot of good points (for me, anyway).
			</section>
			<section>
				If you're reading this, you're considering giving in to your addiction. I know that you know what I'm going to say, but I want you to try to take a moment to slow down and really take this in, please. I know better than anyone how hard this is for you, and I can't get mad at you for the times you didn't have the strength to resist, but I see how upset you get when you give in to this temptation, and I care too much about you to not try to make an effort to help you stop. You said yourself how you decided that this needed to be put to an end, and I just want to support you and maintain your happiness.
			</section>
			<section>
				Let's first reflect upon the reasons you want to stop:
			</section>
			<section>
				Foremost of your reasons is that you don't want to be looked down upon by everyone, but I get it: that's a rather obscure reason, and it's hard for you to make it feel real, so let me try to put this in terms that are more easily relatable. Think of your friends: Think of p09 and p06 and p010; Think of p033 and p015 and p012; Think of p03. These people all care about you, a fact you've witnessed beyond dispute. Naturally, I can't tell the future or read their minds, but I think you can agree that, minimally, they would be disappointed at your actions. Maybe they can look past it; Maybe they don't think it's that big of a deal; Maybe some of them have the same problem. But, regardless, they would wish better for you. I know that there are times when you wonder whether such feelings are justified, and who am I to give a definitive answer on what's justified and what's not, but no matter whether things <em>should</em> be the way they are, there's no changing the fact that things are indeed that way, even for you. Maybe when your thinking processes are impaired, you can ignore all of this, but try to salvage your brain-power: Picture your friends and try to tell me that you don't care about letting them down; Picture p03 and remember what a great time you had together ... now picture her disgust at your excessively explicit description of your addiction ... now think about how you would do just about anything to bring such an amazing person back into your life. You're a great person, and the last thing I would want you to do is to sabotage your ability to be surrounded by equally great people.
			</section>
			<section>
				Another formidable reason is that this has completely taken over your life. Just think about how much time has been wasted dealing with this. Think about all of the homework you didn't finish, all of the meals cut short, all of the sleep lost, all of the conversations you didn't get a chance to have. For years, you've been trying to accommodate this compulsion, but it's brought you nothing but pain. No matter what was going on at the time, if the idea struck you, you were at the mercy of your primal desires. You've always prided yourself on the control you have over yourself, but although your discipline is impressive, this addiction is just a smack in the face to everything else you've accomplished. Time and time again, I've seen you channel your strongest resolve to finally put this vice to rest, and time and time again, I've seen your determination deteriorate at a remarkable speed to be replaced by exceptionally brief relief followed by chronic regret. When this has control of you, you don't care about anything: you don't care about your class that starts in 10 minutes; you don't care about anyone who may disapprove; you don't care about how you'll feel in 5 minutes; you don't care about any deals you made with yourself. All you care about is doing whatever it takes to satisfy your cravings. I'd list the depths you've been willing to stoop to and the principles you've been willing to compromise in the heat of the moment, but depending on how twisted of a state of mind you're in right now, you might find it inspiring. That's not even mentioning the fact that you're so scared of what people might think if they read this (which isn't entirely unlikely) that you wouldn't want to admit to everything that you've done anyway. Suffice it to say that you'll let nothing stand in your way; even the briefest reflection upon your actions makes that abundantly clear.

				Now, realizing the importance of giving all sides their proper weight, let's reflect upon the reasons you want to continue this behavior:
			</section>
			<section>
				It feels really good.
			</section>
			<section>
				Hmmm... It seems like one of these arguments isn't quite as strong as the others. So why is it, then, that this has such a strong hold on you? Let's break this down and try to understand what's going on:
			</section>
			<section>
				Naturally, the place this all starts is in your head. Whether it's spurred by the environment around you or it's just a passing fancy, your thoughts are the seed of your demise. Sure, what you end up thinking often isn't that bad or even directly related, but all it takes is dwelling on a suggestive topic a little bit too long for things to start down an undesirable path. Sometimes it can be hard to make a distinction between what's reasonable to think about and what should be pushed aside, but this is the best place to stop things, and you actually have a fairly high success rate at assigning acceptability to your thoughts; the problem is that you don't make use of it. I know all about your aversion to setting restrictions on what you're allowed to think, but by stopping things before they even start, you're saving yourself a lot of trouble in the future. I know it's hard, but at least try.
			</section>
			<section>
				From there, one of two things can happen: you can convince yourself that giving in to your addiction is okay or you can attempt to stay resilient but make decisions that sabotage your efforts.
			</section>
			<section>
				Let's start with the first scenario.
			</section>
			<section>
				Typically when you've been exhausting yourself with any number of things (homework, sleep-deprivation, stressing over your addiction, etc.), you may come to the conclusion that giving in to your addiction isn't that bad: After all, there's that short period of time when you feel really good, giving in is faster than spending a bunch of time resisting, and it's so taxing trying keep yourself in check. Also, you don't have to feel that bad about it if you decide not to, right? Well, hold up, let's back up a second here; there's some problems with your reasoning: First off, although I can't dispute what chemicals flood your brain, that part about giving in being faster than resisting is just a plain lie; you know good and well that even lengthy struggles to resist, if successful, are almost certainly not any longer than, and are usually shorter than, the converse. This fact is exemplified when you take into account the resulting distraction due to guilt and any actions you may take in an effort to prevent recurrence (such as typing up a lengthy persuasive essay). When it comes to how taxing eternal vigilance can be, I can sympathize with your difficulties, but just because something is hard doesn't mean that it shouldn't be done. Just think about all of the things you've powered through and accomplished even when your lost your enthusiasm: learning to juggle, changing your handwriting, writing the candy cane grams, gathering conversation data, ... You have a nearly unparalleled ability to will yourself to keep going in order to accomplish long-term goals despite significant struggles; you just have to channel that. It's a worthy cause. Finally, I know that you have a lot of control over your emotions, but I don't think there's any escaping feeling bad about succumbing to this addiction. Time after time, you've convinced yourself that you don't need to feel bad, and time after time, you've been racked with guilt and anger afterwards. There have been times when it hasn't been quite like that, but that was mainly when the feeling was helplessness instead. Every time I see you start down this path, I can so easily predict how it will end, and it makes me really sad to see it come to pass. Over and over again, I have to watch you naively determine that you won't feel that bad and then follow it up with intense disappointment and frustration. This consequence is very reliable, and it pains me to see you doom yourself such pain. Please don't hurt yourself like that.

				The other way things can go bad for you is if you don't keep your behavior in check.
