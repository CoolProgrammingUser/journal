			Voting for the Future
		</h1>
		<main>
			<p>
				Our country has many great freedoms, each of which plays a critical role in making it what it is today. Although every freedom is too important to even consider leaving out, the one that I enjoy the most is the freedom to vote. Without this, we wouldn’t be half the country we are today.
			</p>

				Voting is obviously crucial to maintaining democracy. Even though I can’t vote yet, I realize how pivotal this freedom is. When we vote, we determine who our leaders are going to be. Along with this comes the ability to pick our own future. For every person elected, we are putting in a voice that will speak our minds. This voice has the possibility to bring about change that is so desperately desired by many. How do we know this will happen?  Because we put them there. Thanks to this freedom, power-hungry people are withheld from stepping on us to get to the top, and any time one slips through the cracks, their rein of terror is cut short by enforcing our freedom to vote.
			</p>

				Take time to imagine what life would be like if voting was taken away from us. For one thing, we would have no control over who was in power. When people that didn’t have our best interests at heart were put in charge, there would be nothing we could do to influence the laws imposed on us. In addition, the other freedoms we enjoy could be in jeopardy because the collective people that kept them there would no longer have a say. Even if there was a change of power every few years, what’s to guarantee that the next person would be any different?  America wouldn’t be the place that people immigrated to; it would be the place people emigrated from. That is not the type of America I would want to live in.

				Despite the importance of our freedom to vote, there are still numerous people that don’t take advantage of it. These people are either “too busy,” uninformed, or lazy. Very few people don’t vote for a good reason. As stated above, our lives would not be good if we weren’t allowed to vote. When people voluntarily squander this freedom, it’s almost as bad as having that scenario materialize. Voting is one of the best things about this county, one thing that is not meant to be wasted.
			</p>
			<p>
				The freedom to vote is, in my opinion, the most important of our freedoms. It keeps us from going down the wrong path and ensures the preservation of our other freedoms. Without it, America wouldn’t be the same. That is why it is vital that people vote when they can and keep this nation great. The future is in our hands, and the last thing we should do with it is clench our fists.
