				If you know me very well at all, you'll know that, under ordinary circumstances, it's extremely difficult to drag out an opinion from me on how good a person looks beyond a very general evaluation because I don't like being that superficial. However, I'd be lying if I told you I didn't have an opinion at all. Some of you may want to know my thoughts on this subject, so I've compiled things here. Since most people have the same opinion on things like body proportions and general facial features but no one can really do anything about those things, I'm going to restrict my discussion to things that can be changed. If I'm to be completely up-front with you, I have to admit that another motivation behind creating this is to inspire the girls closest to me to wear the things that make them look prettiest, since I'd never tell them any other time. Largely as a way of aleviating my guilt for being so superficial here, I've created a section at the end for people to offer their opinions on what would make me look best. It may be worth noting that it's unlikely you'll be able to address everything you think is relevant about me after only brief consideration; if there's anything I've learned while taking far too much time to think about this, it's that there's a very large variety of ways to alter appearance, and you aren't likely to be able to come up with all of them at once.
