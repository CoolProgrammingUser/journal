			<p>
				This is a series I wrote in fourth grade when we had the chance to free write. To help you know my writing level at this time, I've copied it without correcting any spelling or grammar errors. It's worth noting, though, that a few of the mistakes may have been one-time errors. Also, I improved my writing as the story progressed. The story is told primarily as a dialogue between characters despite the conspicuous lack of quotation marks. Although the very beginning mentions three main characters (which was a surprise to me), I quickly forget about the third person and center the story around two characters and occasionally a mayor. Since I don't really indicate who's talking, it can be difficult to keep track of the speakers, but once you figure it out at a given point, there's a general pattern of switching speakers each sentence. In the original writing, there were pictures scattered throughout the story, but I don't have any of those in here at this time.

					Man this place is gigantic! And full of snow. Hey! What's that! It looks like rain, but it can only snow here. Besides we only had enough money left for one pair of snow shoes and there's ten feet of snow! Hey were'd the rain go? I don't know, it dissapered like magic. How could that happen? Hmmmmm......
