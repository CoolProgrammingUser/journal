			<p>
				This is a series I wrote in fourth grade when we had the chance to free write. To help you know my writing level at this time, I've copied it without correcting any spelling or grammar errors. It's worth noting, though, that a few of the mistakes may have been one-time errors. Also, I improved my writing as the story progressed. The story is told primarily as a dialogue between characters despite the conspicuous lack of quotation marks. Although the very beginning mentions three main characters (which was a surprise to me), I quickly forget about the third person and center the story around two characters and occasionally a mayor.

				<section>
					Man this place is gigantic! And full of snow. Hey! What's that! It looks like rain, but it can only snow here. Besides we only had enough money left for one pair of snow shoes and there's ten feet of snow! Hey were'd the rain go? I don't know, it dissapered like magic. How could that happen? Hmmmmm......
				</section>
				<h3>
					5 minutes later

				<section>
					I got it! It was going to snow but our hot engine gas melted it to rain and then melted the cloud! Dout it, we didn't come by here even with the helicopter. Let's go over there and investigate.

					Here are the facts.
				</section>
				<div class="paper">
					&bull; It eats meat &bull; It uses it's four long tonges that look like seaweed to lewer prey &bull; So streachy mouth it can streach to it's stem &bull; Very sharp needeles that work like evergreen trees leafs a few inches behind mouth &bull; when it gets to cold or it has snow on it, it sucks up water, warms it up in it's mout and spits it out to rain on it's self &bull; when a fish brushes the pretend sea weed it pollinates the plant and seeds start collecting in it's stomac and when it starts to snow it spits them out so they will be incubated and grow &bull; it's roots are just hot enough
				</div>
				<section>
					(Imagine that the writing went to the end of the page and the rest of the paper was ripped off.)
				</section>
				<section>
