				Welcome to my journal. In this, I have recorded everything you could ever want to know about me: every life event, every thought, every feeling, everything.<note->*<div><div>Okay, I can't talk about <em>everything</em>, but I can get pretty close.</div></div></note-> If I've asked you to read this, it's because I consider you to be a valued friend, and I've decided that it's time to tell you as much as I can about myself. Although some people know a fair amount about me, there's always significant gaps. (That includes you.) I have a tendency to keep things to myself, and if I say anything, it's likely understated. With this, there will be nothing left to wonder about. It's my hope that, after you read this, you'll understand me better, and I'll be able to allow myself to get closer to you. Something I can't stress enough is that I don't want to talk about anything in here until you've finished reading: I don't want to give a pathetic summarization of something that I might have a hard time talking about when it's exceptionally likely that I address it later. Other than that, although I won't swear you to absolute secrecy (as if I could), things can get quite personal in here so I ask that you to use discretion when deciding who to tell what. Also, don't read things out of order: For one thing, you might not understand what I'm talking about if you skip ahead, but for another thing, your arrival at this journal surely isn't a surprise to me, so I'll likely try to put some sort of profound entry at the end; if you just read the last part first, it'll lose its impact. I'm not concerned with how long it will take you to read this, but I hope you can make the time. As for anything else, I think my journal will speak for itself.
